<p>I was sitting at a late hour in my room above the
college Yard, correcting daily themes. I had sat at
a late hour in my room above the college Yard,
correcting daily themes, for it seemed an interminable
number of years&#8211;was it six or seven? I had no great
love for it, certainly. Some men who go into teaching,
and of course all men who become great teachers, do
have a genuine love for their work. But I am afraid
I was one of those unfortunates who take up teaching
as a stop-gap, a means of livelihood while awaiting
&#8220;wider opportunities.&#8221; These opportunities in my
case were to be the authorship of an epoch-making
novel, or a great drama, or some similar masterpiece.
I had been accredited with &#8220;brilliant promise&#8221; in my
undergraduate days, and the college had taken me into
the English department upon graduation.</p>

<p>Well, that was seven years ago. I was still correcting
daily themes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>It was a warm night in early April. I had a touch
of spring fever, and wrote vicious, sarcastic comments
on the poor undergraduate pages of unexpressiveness
before me, as through my open windows drifted up
from the Yard a snatch of song from some returning
theatre party. Most of these themes were hopeless.
Your average man has no sense of literature. Moreover,
by the time he reaches college it is too late to
teach him even common, idiomatic expressiveness.
That ought to be done in the secondary schools&#8211;and
isn&#8217;t. I toiled on. Near the bottom of the pile came
the signature, James Robinson. I opened the sheet
with relief. He was one of the few in the class with
the real literary instinct&#8211;a lad from some nearby New
England village who went home over Sunday and
brought back unconscious records of his changing life
there. I enjoyed the little drama, for I, too, had come
from a suburban village, and knew the first bitter awakening
to its narrowness.</p>

<p>I opened the theme, and this is what I read:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;The April sun has come at last, and the first warmth
of it lays a benediction on the spirit, even as it tints
the earth with green. Our barn door, standing open,
framed a picture this morning between walls of golden
hay&#8211;the soft rolling fields, the fringe of woodland
beyond veiled with a haze of budding life, and then the
far line of the hills. A horse stamped in the shadows;
a hen strolled out upon the floor, cooting softly; there
was a warm, earthy smell in the air, the distant church
bell sounded pleasantly over the fields, and up the road
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>I heard the rattle of Uncle Amos&#8217;s carryall, bearing the
family to meeting. The strife of learning, the pride
of the intellect, the academic urge&#8211;where were they?
I found myself wandering out from the barnyard into
the fields, filled with a great longing to hold a plow in
the furrow till tired out, and then to lie on my back in
the sun and watch the lazy clouds.&#8221;</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>So Robinson had spring fever, too! How it makes
us turn back home! I made some flattering comment
or other on the paper (especially, I recall, starring the
verb <i>coot</i> as good hen lore), and put it with the rest.
Then I fell to dreaming. Home! I, John Upton,
academic bachelor, had no home, no parents, no kith
nor kin. I had my study lined with books, my little
monastic bedroom behind it, my college position, and
a shabby remnant of my old ambitions. The soft
&#8220;coot, coot&#8221; of a hen picking up grain on the old barn
floor! I closed my eyes in delicious memory&#8211;memory
of my grandfather&#8217;s farm down in Essex County. The
sweet call of the village church bell came back to me,
the drone of the preacher, the smell of lilacs outside,
the stamp of an impatient horse in the horse sheds
where liniment for man and beast was advertised on tin
posters!</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t I go back to it, and give up this grind?&#8221;
I thought. Then, being an English instructor, I added
learnedly, &#8220;and be a disciple of Rousseau!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a warm April night, and I was foolish with
spring fever. I began to play with the idea. I got up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
and opened my tin box, to investigate the visible paper
tokens of my little fortune. There was, in all, about
$30,000, the result of my legacy from my parents and
my slender savings from my slender salary, for I had
never had any extravagances except books and golf
balls. I had heard of farms being bought for $1,500.
That would still leave me more than $1,200 a year.
Perhaps, with the freedom from this college grind, I
could write some of those masterpieces at last&#8211;even a
best seller! I grew as rosy with hope as an undergraduate.
I looked at myself in the glass&#8211;not yet
bald, face smooth, rather academic, shoulders good,
thanks to daily rowing. Hands hard, too! I sought
for a copy of the <i>Transcript</i>, and ran over the real estate
ads. Here was a gentleman&#8217;s estate, with two butler&#8217;s
pantries and a concrete garage&#8211;<i>that</i> would hardly do!
No, I should have to consult somebody. Besides
$1,200 a year would hardly be enough to run even a
$1,500 farm on, not for a year or two, because I should
have to hire help. I must find something practical
to do to support myself. What? What <i>could</i> I do,
except put sarcastic comments on the daily themes of
helpless undergraduates? I went to bed with a very
poor opinion of English instructors.</p>

<p>But God, as the hymn remarks, works in a mysterious
way His wonders to perform. Waking with my flicker
of resolution quite gone out, I met my chief in the English
department who quite floored me by asking me if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
I could find the extra time&#8211;&#8220;without interfering with
my academic duties&#8221;&#8211;to be a reader for a certain
publishing house which had just consulted him about
filling a vacancy. I told him frankly that if I got the
job I might give up my present post and buy a farm,
but as he didn&#8217;t think anybody could live on a manuscript
reader&#8217;s salary, he laughed and didn&#8217;t believe me,
and two days later I had the job. It would be a secret
to disclose my salary, but to a man who had been an
English instructor in an American college for seven
years, it looked good enough. Then came the Easter
vacation.</p>

<p>Professor Farnsworth, of the economics department,
had invited me on a motor trip for the holidays. (The
professor married a rich widow.)</p>

<p>&#8220;As the Cheshire cat said to Alice,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;it doesn&#8217;t matter which way you go, if you don&#8217;t much
care where you are going to; and we don&#8217;t, do we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I want to look at farms.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he only laughed, too. &#8220;Anyhow, we won&#8217;t look
at a single undergraduate,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>In the course of our motor flight from the Eternal
Undergraduate, we reached one night a certain elm-hung
New England village noted for its views and its
palatial summer estates, and put up at the hotel there.
The professor, whose hobby is real estate values, fell
into a discussion with the suave landlord on the subject,
considered locally. (Being a state congressman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
he was unable to consider anything except locally!)
The landlord, to our astonishment, informed us that
building-sites on the village street and the nearby hills
sold as high as $5,000 per acre.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does farm land cost?&#8221; I inquired sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As much as the farmer can induce you to pay,&#8221; he
laughed. &#8220;But if you were a farmer, you might get
it for $100 an acre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> a farmer,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Where is there a farm for
sale?&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlord looked at me dubiously. But he volunteered
this information: &#8220;When you leave in the
morning, take the back road, up the hollow, toward
what we call Slab City. You&#8217;ll pass a couple of big
estates. About half a mile beyond the second estate,
you&#8217;ll come to a crossroad. Turn up that a hundred
yards or so and ask for Milt Noble at the first house you
come to. Maybe he&#8217;ll sell.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a glorious April morning when we awoke. The
roads were dry. Spring was in the air. The grass had
begun to show green on the beautiful lawns of Bentford
Main Street. The great elms drooped their slender,
bare limbs like cathedral arches. We purred softly up
the Slab City road, pleased by the name of it, passed
the two estates on the hill outside of the village, and
then dipped into a hollow. As this hollow held no
extended prospect, the summer estates had ceased on
its brim. The road became the narrow dirt track of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
tradition, bramble-lined. Presently we reached the
crossroad. A groggy sign-board stood in the little
delta of grass and weeds so characteristic of old New
England crossroads, and on it a clumsy hand pointed
to &#8220;Albany.&#8221; As Albany was half a day&#8217;s run in a
motor car, and no intervening towns were mentioned,
there was a fine, roving spirit about this groggy old
sign which tickled me.</p>

<p>We ran up the road a hundred yards of the fifty miles
to Albany, crossed a little brook, and stopped the motor
at what I instantly knew for my abode.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how I knew it. One doesn&#8217;t reason
about such things any more than one reasons about
falling in love. At least, I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t, nor could I
set out in cold blood to seek a residence, calculating
water supply, quality of neighbours, fashionableness of
site, nearness to railroad, number of closets, and all the
rest. I saw the place, and knew it for mine&#8211;that&#8217;s
all.</p>

<p>As the motor stopped, I took a long look to left and
right, sighed, and said to the professor: &#8220;I hereby resign
my position as instructor in English, to take effect
immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor laughed. He didn&#8217;t yet believe I
meant it.</p>

<p>My grandfather was an Essex County farmer, and
lived in a rectangular, simple, lovely old house, with
woodsheds rambling indefinitely out behind and a big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
barn across the road, with a hollow-log watering trough
by a pump in front and a picture of green fields framed
by the little door at the far end. Grandfather&#8217;s house
and grandfather&#8217;s barn, visited every summer, were the
sweetest recollections of my childhood. And here they
were again&#8211;somewhat dilapidated, to be sure, with a
mountain in the barn-door vista instead of the pleasant
fields of Essex&#8211;but still true to the old Yankee type,
with the same old wooden pump by the hollow-log
trough, green with moss.</p>

<p>I jumped from the motor and started toward the
house on the run.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221; cried the professor, laughing, &#8220;you poor
young idiot!&#8221; Then, in a lower tone, he cautioned: &#8220;If
our friend Milt sees you want this place so badly, he&#8217;ll
run up the price. Where&#8217;s your Yankee blood?&#8221;</p>

<p>I sobered down to a walk, and together we slipped
behind a century-old lilac bush at the corner of the
house, and sought the front of the dwelling unobserved.
The house was set with its side to the road, about one
hundred feet into the lot. A long ell ran out behind,
evidently containing the kitchen and then the sheds
and outhouses. The side door, on a grape-shadowed
porch, was in this ell, facing the barn across the way.
The main body of the dwelling was the traditional,
simple block, with a fine old doorway, composed of
simple Doric pilasters supporting a hand-hewn broken
pediment&#8211;now, alas! broken in more than an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
architectural sense. It was a typical house of the splendid
carpenter-and-builder period of a century ago.</p>

<p>This front door faced into an aged and now sadly
dilapidated orchard. Once there had been a path to
the road, but this was now overgrown, and the doorsteps
had rotted away. The orchard ran down a slope
of perhaps half an acre to the ferny tangle of the brook
bed. Beyond that was a bordering line of ash-leaf
maples, evidently marking the other road out of which
we had turned. The winters had racked the poor old
orchard, and great limbs lay on the ground. What
remained were bristling with suckers. The sills of the
house were still hidden under banks of leaves, held in
place by boards, to keep out the winter cold. There
were no curtains in the windows, nor much sign of
furniture within. From this view the old house looked
abandoned. It had evidently not been painted for
twenty years.</p>

<p>But, as I stood before the battered doorway and
looked down through the storm-racked orchard to the
brook, I had a sudden vision of pink trees abloom above
a lawn, and through them the shimmer of a garden pool
and the gleam of a marble bench or, maybe, a wooden
bench painted white. On the whole, that would be
more in keeping. This Thing called gardening had
got hold of me already! I was planning for next year!</p>

<p>&#8220;You could make a terrace out here, instead of a
veranda,&#8221; I was saying to the professor. &#8220;White
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
wicker furniture on the grass before this Colonial doorway!
It&#8217;s ideal!&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled. &#8220;How about the plumbing?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>I waved away such matters, and we returned around
the giant lilac tree to the side door, searching for Milton
Noble. A bent old lady peered over her spectacles at
us, and allowed Milt wuz out tew the barn. He was,
standing in the door contemplating our car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mornin&#8217;,&#8221; said he, peering sharply at me with gray
eyes that twinkled palely above a great tangle of white
whisker.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine old house you have,&#8221; I continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hed first-growth timber when &#8217;twas built. Why
wouldn&#8217;t it be?&#8221; He spat lazily, and wiped the back of
his hand across his whiskers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hear you want to sell it, though?&#8221; My sentence
was a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunno whar you heerd thet,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I hain&#8217;t
said I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>We mentioned the innkeeper&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph,&#8221; said Milt, &#8220;Tom knows more about folks
sometimes then they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to sell?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wanter buy?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>There was not the slightest expression of mirth on
his face. The professor did not know whether to laugh
or not. But I laughed. I was born of Yankee stock.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about water?&#8221; I asked, becoming very practical.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;thet never dried up. Town main
comes down the ro&#8217;d yander, from the Slab City reservoar.
You kin tap thet if well water hain&#8217;t good enough
fer ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bathrooms?&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>The old man spat again. &#8220;Brook makes a pool
sometimes down yander,&#8221; he replied, jerking his thumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we take a look into the house?&#8221; suggested
the professor.</p>

<p>The old man moved languidly from the door. As
he stepped, his old black trouser leg pulled up over his
shoe top, and we saw that he wore no stockings. He
paused in front of the motor car. &#8220;How much did thet
benzine buggy cost?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four thousand dollars,&#8221; said the owner.</p>

<p>The gray eyes darted a look into the professor&#8217;s face;
then they became enigmatic. &#8220;Powerful lot o&#8217; money,&#8221;
he mused, moving on. &#8220;Whar&#8217;s yourn?&#8221; he added
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had one of those, I couldn&#8217;t have your farm,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>He squinted shrewdly. &#8220;Dunno&#8217;s yer kin, anyway,
do ye?&#8221; was his reply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>He now led us into the kitchen. We saw the face
of the old lady peering at us from the &#8220;butt&#8217;ry.&#8221; A
modern range was backed up against a huge, old-fashioned
brick oven, no longer used. A copper pump,
with a brass knob on the curved handle, stood at one
end of the sink&#8211;&#8220;Goes ter the well,&#8221; said Milt. The
floor was of ancient, hardwood planking, now worn
into polished ridges. A door led up a low step into the
main house, which consisted, downstairs, of two rooms,
dusty and disused, to the left, and two similar rooms,
used as bedrooms, to the south (all four containing fireplaces),
and a hall, where a staircase with carved rail
led to the hall above, flanked by four chambers, each
with its fireplace, too. Over the kitchen was a long, unfinished
room easily converted into a servant&#8217;s quarters.
Secretly pleased beyond measure at the excellent preservation
of the interior, I kept a discreet silence, and
with an air of great wisdom began my inspection of
the farm.</p>

<p>Twenty acres of the total thirty were on the side of
the road with the house, and the lot was almost square&#8211;about
three hundred yards to a side. Down along
the brook the land had been considered worthless.
South of the orchard it had grown to sugar maple for a
brief space, then to young pine, evidently seedlings of
some big trees now cut down, with a little tamarack
swamp in the far corner. The pines again ran up the
southern boundary from this swamp. The brook flowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
cheerily below the orchard, wound amid the open
grove of maples, and went with a little drop over green
stones into the dusk of the pines. The rest of the land,
which lay up a slope to a point a little west of the house
and then extended along a level plateau, was either
pasture or good average tillage, fairly heavy, with subsoil
enough to hold the dressing. It had, however, I
fancied, been neglected for many years, like the tumbling
stone walls which bounded it, and which also enclosed
a four or five acre hayfield occupying the entire
southwestern corner of the lot, on the plateau. The
professor, who married a summer estate as well as
a motor car, confirmed me in this. Behind the barn,
on the other side of the road, the rectangular ten-acre
lot was rough second-growth timber by the brook,
and cow pasture all up the slope and over the plateau.</p>

<p>Returning to the house, we took a sample of the
water from the well for analysis. When I asked the
old lady (I made the mistake of calling her Mrs. Noble)
to boil the bottle and the cork first, I think they both
decided I was mad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said I, as I put the sample in my pocket,
&#8220;if this water gets a clean bill of health, what do you
want for the place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you give me?&#8221; said Milt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;m a Yankee, too, and I can
answer one question with another just as long as you
can. What do you expect me to give you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>The old man spat meditatively, and wiped his whiskers
with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pitt Perkins got $500 an acre for his place,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;They get $500 a square foot on Wall Street in New
York,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;And &#8217;twon&#8217;t grow corn, neither,&#8221; said Milt, with
his nearest approximation to a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;It pastures lambs,&#8221; put in the professor.</p>

<p>But Milt didn&#8217;t look at him. He gazed meditatively
at the motor. &#8220;So thet contraption cost $4,000, did
it?&#8221; he mused, as if to himself, &#8220;and &#8217;twon&#8217;t drop a
calf, neither. How&#8217;d $8,000 strike you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the bottle of well water from my pocket, and
extended it toward him. &#8220;Here,&#8221; I said, &#8220;there&#8217;s no
need for me to have this analyzed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four!&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a cent over four,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said he, &#8220;didn&#8217;t much want ter sell anyhow.&#8221;
And he pocketed the bottle.</p>

<p>I climbed into the car, and the professor walked in
front and cranked it. (It had a self-starter, which was,
as they usually appear to be, out of commission.) The
engine began to throb. The professor put on his gloves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five,&#8221; said Milt, &#8220;with the hoss an&#8217; two Jerseys an&#8217;
all the wood in the shed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was standing in the road beside the modern motor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
car, a pathetic old figure to me, so like my grandfather
in many ways, the last of an ancient order. Poverty,
decay, was written on him, as on his farmstead.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s yours!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>I got out of the car again, and we made arrangements
to meet in the village and put the deal through. Then
I asked him the question which had been pressing from
the first. &#8220;Why do you sell?&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed toward a distant estate, with great chimneys
and gables, crowning a hill. &#8220;This hain&#8217;t my
country no more,&#8221; he said, with a kind of mournful
dignity. &#8220;It&#8217;s theirs, and theirs, and theirs. I&#8217;m too
old ter l&#8217;arn ter lick boots an&#8217; run a farm fer another
feller. I wuz brought up on corn bread, not shoe polish.
I got a daughter out in York State, an&#8217; she&#8217;ll take me
in if I pay my board. I guess $5,000 &#8217;ll last me &#8217;bout
as long as my breath will. Yer got a good farm here&#8211;if
yer can afford ter put some money back inter the soil.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked out over his fields and we looked mercifully
into the motor. The professor backed the car around,
and we said good-bye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope the bilin&#8217; kills all them bugs in the bottle,&#8221;
was the old man&#8217;s final parting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; I cried, as we spun down over the bridge at
my brook, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a country estate of my own! I&#8217;ve
got a home! I&#8217;ve got freedom!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got stuck,&#8221; said the professor. &#8220;He&#8217;d have
taken $4,000.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s a thousand dollars, more or less?&#8221; said I.
&#8220;Besides, the poor old fellow needs it worse than I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a thousand dollars,&#8221; replied my companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to you,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;You are a professor of
economics. But to me it&#8217;s nothing, for I&#8217;m an instructor
in English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the point is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I&#8217;m going back home!&#8221; I cried. And I took
off my hat and let the April wind rush through my hair.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span><a id='link_2'></a>Chapter II<br /><span class='h2fs'>MY MONEY GOES AND MY FARMER COMES</span></h2>

<p>Three days later I got a report on the water from a
chemist in Springfield; it was pure. Meanwhile, I
had decided to tap the town main, so it didn&#8217;t make
any difference, anyway. We ran the car back to Bentford,
and I closed the deal, took an inventory of the
farm implements and equipment which went with the
place, made a few hasty arrangements for my permanent
coming, and hastened back to college. There I
remained only long enough to see that the faculty had
a competent man to fill my unexpired term (so much of
conscience remained to me!), to pack up my books,
pictures, and furniture, to purchase a few necessary
household goods, or what I thought were necessary,
and to consult the college botanical department. Professor
Grey of the department assigned his chief assistant
at the gardens to my case. He took me to Boston,
and, armed with my inventory, in one day he spent
exactly $641 of my precious savings, while I gasped,
helpless in my ignorance. He bought, it appeared to
me, barrels of seeds, tons of fertilizers, thousands of
wheel hoes for horse and man, millions of pruning saws
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
and spraying machines, hotbed frames and sashes, tomato
trellises, and I knew not what other nameless
implements and impedimenta.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he cried, at 5 <span class='sc'>p.m.</span> &#8220;Now you can make
a beginning. You&#8217;ll have to find out this summer
what else you need. Probably you&#8217;ll want to sink another
$600 in the fall. I told &#8217;em not to ship your
small fruits&#8211;raspberries, etc.&#8211;till you ordered &#8217;em to.
You won&#8217;t be ready for some weeks. The first thing
you must do now is to hire a first-class farmer and call
in a tree specialist. Meanwhile, I&#8217;ll give you a batch of
government bulletins on orchards, field crops, cattle,
and the like. You&#8217;d better read &#8217;em up right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re damn cheerful about it!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;You
talk as if I were a millionaire, with nothing to do but
read bulletins and spend money!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about all you will do, for the next twelve
months,&#8221; he grinned.</p>

<p>This was rather disconcerting. But the die was
cast, and I came to a sudden realization that seven years
of teaching the young idea how to punctuate isn&#8217;t the
best possible training for running a farm, and if I were
to get out of my experiment with a whole skin I had
got to turn to and be my own chief labourer, and hereafter
my own purchaser, as well.</p>

<p>All that night I packed and planned, and the next
morning I left college forever. I slipped away quietly,
before the chapel bell had begun to ring, avoiding all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
tender good-byes. I had a stack of experiment station
bulletins in my grip, and during the four hours I spent
on the train my eyes never left their pages. Four hours
is not enough to make a man a qualified agriculturist,
but it is sufficient to make him humble. I had left
college without any sentimental regrets, my head being
too full of plans and projects. I arrived at Bentford
without any sentimental enthusiasms, my head being
too full of rules for pruning and spraying, for cover
crops, for tuberculin tests, for soil renewal. I&#8217;m sorry
to confess this, because in all the &#8220;back to the land&#8221;
books I have read&#8211;especially the popular ones, and I
want this one to be popular, for certain very obvious
reasons&#8211;the hero has landed on his new-found acres
with all kinds of fine emotions and superb sentiments.
The city folks who read his book, sitting by their steam
radiators in their ten by twelve flats, love to fancy
these emotions, glow to these sentiments. But I, alas,
for seven long years preached realism to my classes,
and even now the chains are on me; I must tell the
truth. I landed at Bentford station, hired a hack, and
drove at once to my farm, and my first thought on
alighting was this: &#8220;Good Lord, I never realized the
frightful condition of that orchard! It will take me a
solid week to save any of it, and I suppose I&#8217;ll have to
set out a lot of new trees besides. More expense!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dollar up here,&#8221; said the driver of the hack,
in a mildly insidious voice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>I paid him brusquely, and he drove away. I stood
in the middle of the road, my suitcase beside me, the
long afternoon shadows coming down through my dilapidated
orchard, and surveyed the scene. Milt Noble
had gone. So had my enthusiasm. The house was
bare and desolate. It hadn&#8217;t been painted for twenty
years, at the least, I decided. My trunks, which I
had sent ahead by express, were standing disconsolately
on the kitchen porch. Behind me I heard my
horse stamping in the stable, and saw my two cows
feeding in the pasture. A postcard from one Bert
Temple, my nearest neighbour up the Slab City road,
had informed me that he was milking them for me&#8211;and,
I gathered, for the milk. Well, if he didn&#8217;t, goodness
knew who would! I never felt so lonely, so helpless,
so hopeless, in my life.</p>

<p>Then an odd fancy struck me. George Meredith
made <i>his</i> living, too, by reading manuscripts for a publisher!
The picture of George Meredith trying to reclaim
a New England farm as an avocation restored my
spirits, though just why, perhaps it would be difficult
to make any one but a fellow English instructor understand.
I suddenly tossed my suitcase into the barn,
and began a tour of inspection over my thirty acres.</p>

<p>There was tonic in that turn! Twenty of my acres,
as I have said, lay on the south side of the road, surrounding
the house. The other ten, behind the barn,
were pasture. The old orchard in front of the house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
(which faced the east, instead of the road) led down a
slope half an acre in extent to the brook. That brook
ran south close to the road which formed my eastern
boundary, along the entire extent of the farm&#8211;some
three hundred yards. At first it flowed through a
wild tangle of weeds and wild flowers, then entered a
grove of maples, then a stand of white pines, and finally
burbled out into a swampy little grove of tamaracks.
I walked down through the orchard, seeing again the
white bench across the brook, against the roadside
hedge, and seeing now tall iris flowers besides, and a
lily pool&#8211;all &#8220;the sweetest delight of gardens,&#8221; as
Sir Thomas Browne mellifluously put it. As I followed
the brook into the maples and then into the sudden
hushed quiet of my little stand of pines, I thought how
all this was mine&#8211;my own, to play with, to develop as
a sculptor molds his clay, to walk in, to read in, to
dream in. Think of owning even a half acre of pine
woods, stillest and coolest of spots! I planned my
path beside the brook as I went along, and my spirits
rose like the songs of the sparrows from the roadside
trees beyond.</p>

<p>The bulk of my farm lay to the south of the house, on
a gentle slope which rose from the brook to a pasture
plateau higher than the dwelling. Most of the slope had
been cultivated, and some of it had been ploughed in
the fall. I climbed westward, a hundred yards south of
the house, over the rough ground, looked into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
hayfield, and then continued along the wall of the hayfield,
over ground evidently used as pasture, to my western
boundary, where my acres met the cauliflower fields of
my neighbour, Bert Temple.</p>

<p>A single great pine, with wide-spreading, storm-tossed
branches, like a cedar of Lebanon, stood at the stone
wall, just inside my land. The wall, indeed, ran almost
over its roots, a pretty, gray, bramble-covered
wall, so old that it looked like a work of nature. Beneath
the lower limbs of the pine, and over the wall,
one saw the blue mountains framed like a Japanese
print. Standing off a way, however, the pine stood out
sharply against the hills and the sky, a noble veteran,
almost black.</p>

<p>Then and there I saw my book plate&#8211;a coloured
woodcut, green and blue, with the pine in black on the
key block!</p>

<p>Then I reflected how I stood on soil which must be
made to pay me back in potatoes for the outlay, stood,
as it were, on top of my practical problem&#8211;and dreamed
of book plates!</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Somebody</i> ought to get amusement out of this!&#8221;
I said aloud, as I set off for the barn, gathered up my
suitcase, and climbed the road toward Bert Temple&#8217;s.</p>

<p>If I live to be a hundred, I can never repay Bert
Temple, artist in cauliflowers and best of friends in my
hour of need. Bert and his wife took me in, treated me
as a human, if helpless, fellow being, not as a &#8220;city
man&#8221; to be fleeced, and gave me the best advice and the
best supper a man ever had, meantime assuring me
that my cows had been tested, and both were sound.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>The supper came first. I hadn&#8217;t eaten such a supper
since grandmother died. There were brown bread Joes&#8211;only
rival of Rhode Island Johnny cake for the title
of the lost ambrosia of Olympus. They were so hot
that the butter melted over them instantly, and crisp
outside, with delicious, runny insides.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Temple,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t eaten brown
bread Joes since I was a boy. I didn&#8217;t know the secret
existed any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple beamed over her ample and calico-covered
bosom. &#8220;You must hev come from Essex or
Middlesex counties,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you&#8217;ve et brown
bread Joes before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Essex,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Essex!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Well, well! I came from
Georgetown. Bert, he&#8217;s Middlesex. I dunno what
we&#8217;re doing out here in these ungodly, half York State
mountains, but here we be, and the secret&#8217;s with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me have some more of the secret,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;I&#8217;m growing younger with every mouthful.&#8221;</p>

<p>After supper Bert took me in hand. &#8220;First thing
fer you to do&#8217;s to git a farmer <i>and</i> carpenter,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I kin git yer both, if yer want I should, an&#8217; not sting
yer. Most noo folks thet come here gits stung. Seems
like Bentford thinks thet&#8217;s why they come!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m clay in your hands,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, yer don&#8217;t exactly know <i>me</i> intimately,&#8221; said
Bert with a laugh, &#8220;so yer&#8217;d better git a bit o&#8217; granite
into yer system. Neow, ez to a farmer&#8211;there&#8217;s Mike
Finn. He&#8217;s not French, ez yer might guess, but he&#8217;s
honest ez the 21st o&#8217; June is long, an&#8217; he&#8217;s out of a job
on account of the Sulloways hevin&#8217; sold their estate
whar he wuz gardener an&#8217; the noo folks bringin&#8217; their
own, an&#8217; he lives &#8217;bout a quarter of a mile from your
corner. He&#8217;ll come an&#8217; his son&#8217;ll help out with the
heavy work, sech ez ploughin&#8217;, which you&#8217;d better begin
termorrer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike it is,&#8221; said I. &#8220;What will he want for
wages?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll ask yer $60 a month, an&#8217; take $45, an&#8217; earn
it all,&#8221; Bert answered. &#8220;We&#8217;ll walk deown an&#8217; see
him neow, ef yer like.&#8221;</p>

<p>I liked, and in the soft, spring evening we set off
down the road. &#8220;But,&#8221; I was saying, &#8220;$45 a month
for skilled labour seems to me a measly wage. I&#8217;m
ashamed to offer it. Why, college instructors get as
much as that! I shall offer Mike $50.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do yer want ter spile all the hired help in Bentford?&#8221;
cried Bert.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I, &#8220;but Mike gets $50, and perhaps a
raise if he makes good. I believe in the hire being
worth the labourer. That&#8217;s flat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, then, ez to carpenters,&#8221; Bert switched, seeing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
that I could not be budged; &#8220;thar&#8217;s good carpenters,
an&#8217; bad carpenters, an&#8217; Hard Cider Howard. Hard
Cider&#8217;s fergotten more abeout carpent&#8217;rin&#8217; then most
o&#8217; the rest ever knoo, and he ain&#8217;t fergot much,
neither. But he ain&#8217;t handsome, and he looks upon
the apple juice when it&#8217;s yaller. Maybe yer don&#8217;t
mind looks, an&#8217; I kin keep Hard Cider sober while
he&#8217;s on your job. He&#8217;ll treat yer fair, an&#8217; see thet
the plumbers do, an&#8217; fix all them rotten sills ez good ez
noo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said I. &#8220;Rotten sills?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Bert answered. &#8220;Mean to tell me yer didn&#8217;t
know thet? Yer can&#8217;t pack all yer sills with leaves
fer a hundred years, an&#8217; not take &#8217;em away summers
half the time, an&#8217; <i>not</i> rot yer sills. I&#8217;d say, treat &#8217;em
with cement like they do trees neow.&#8221;</p>

<p>I began to have visions of my remaining $24,000
melting away in sills.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose the barn is rotten, too?&#8221; said I, faintly,
as an interrogation.</p>

<p>We were then passing the barn. Bert stepped in&#8211;the
door wasn&#8217;t locked&#8211;lit a lantern, came out with it,
and led me around to one side. He held the lantern
against one of the timbers which formed the foundation
frame. It was a foot in diameter, and made of hand-hewn
oak! Though it had never been guilty of paint,
it looked as solid as a rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barn needs some patchin&#8217; and floorin&#8217; and a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
shingles,&#8221; said Bert, &#8220;but it ain&#8217;t doo to fall deown
jest yit!&#8221;</p>

<p>He put the lantern back, and we walked on, turned
the corner at my brook, and followed the other road
along past my pines till we came to a small settlement
of white cottages. At one of these Bert knocked. We
were admitted by a pretty, blue-eyed Irish girl, who
had a copy of C√¶sar&#8217;s Commentaries in her hand,
into a tiny parlour where an &#8220;airtight&#8221; stove stood
below a coloured chromo of the Virgin and Child, and
a middle-aged Irishman sat in his shirt sleeves, smoking
a pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Mike,&#8221; said Bert, &#8220;this is Mr. John Upton,
who&#8217;s bought Milt Noble&#8217;s place, an&#8217; wants a farmer
<i>and</i> gardener. I told him you wuz the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, sor, sit down,&#8221; said Mike, offering a chair
with an expansive and hospitable gesture. &#8220;Sure,
let&#8217;s talk it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pretty daughter had gone back to her C√¶sar
by the nickel oil lamp, but she had one ear toward us,
and I caught a corner of her eye, too&#8211;an extremely
attractive, not to say provocative, eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; Mike was saying, &#8220;sure I can run a
farm, but what do I be gettin&#8217; for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty a month,&#8221; said I, &#8220;which includes milking the
cows and tending furnace in winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I got more than that on me last place and no
cows at all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re a liar, Mike,&#8221; said Bert.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fightin&#8217; word in the ould country,&#8221; said
Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t the old country, and yer got $45,&#8221; Bert
grinned. &#8220;Besides, yer&#8217;ll be close to yer work. You
wuz a mile an&#8217; a half frum the Sulloways. Thet makes
up fer the milkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, true,&#8221; Mike replied, meditatively. &#8220;But
what be yer runnin&#8217; the place for, Mr. Upton? Is it a
real farmer ye&#8217;d be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A real farmer,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t know. Onct I worked fer one o&#8217;
them literary fellers that married rich, and he was always
fer makin&#8217; me try new-fangled things in the ground
instead o&#8217; good old cow manure. Begorra, he nigh
drove the life out o&#8217; me with his talk o&#8217; bac-bac-bac
somethin&#8217;&#8211;some kind of bugs, if ye can beat that&#8211;that
he said made nitrogen. I&#8217;ve heard say yer
wuz a literary feller, too, Mr. Upton, and I have me
doubts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am a sort of a literary feller,&#8221; I confessed,
&#8220;but I never married a rich wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, ye&#8217;re not so old to be past hopin&#8217;,&#8221; Mike
replied.</p>

<p>I shook my head, and added, &#8220;But it&#8217;s you I want to
be the real literary feller, Mike. You must write me a
poem in potatoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike put back his head and roared. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pome
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
yer want, is it?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s an oration I&#8217;ll
give ye. I&#8217;ll grow ye the real home rule pertaters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said I, rising, &#8220;do you begin to-morrow morning,
and will your son help for a few weeks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The mornin&#8217; it is,&#8221; said Mike, &#8220;and Joe along.&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused by the side of the girl. &#8220;All Gaul is divided
into three parts,&#8221; I laughed.</p>

<p>She looked up with a pretty smile, but Mike spoke:
&#8220;Sure, but they give all three parts to Nora,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;so what was the use o&#8217; dividin&#8217; it? She thinks she&#8217;s
me mither instead o&#8217; me daughter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put you to bed in a minute,&#8221; said Nora, while
Mike grinned proudly at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to like Mike,&#8221; said I to Bert, as we walked
back up the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knoo yer would soon ez I seen yer,&#8221; Bert replied.
&#8220;The only folks thet don&#8217;t like Mike is the folks thet
can&#8217;t see a joke. Mike has a tolerable number o&#8217; dislikers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got my farmer,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and now I suppose
I&#8217;ve got to find a housekeeper, as soon as the house
is ready to live in. Nora would suit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon she would,&#8221; Bert replied, &#8220;but she wouldn&#8217;t
soot Bentford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words, I want an oldish woman, very plain,
and preferably a widow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With a young son old enough ter help on the farm,&#8221;
Bert added with a grin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you know of just that combination?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon I dew. You leave it to my old lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Temple,&#8221; said I, &#8220;seems to me I&#8217;m leaving
everything to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, neow, yer might do a heap sight worse!&#8221; said
Bert.</p>

<p>I went up to my chamber when we got back, and sat
down beside my little glass lamp and did some figuring.
I had $24,000 of my savings left, and out of that
I subtracted another $2,000 for the carpenters and
plumbers. That left me with an income from my investments
of about $1,000 a year. Added to my alleged
salary as a manuscript reader, along with what I hoped
I could pick up writing, I recklessly calculated my annual
income as a possible $3,000. Out of this I subtracted
$600 for Mike&#8217;s wages, $360 for a housekeeper,
$400 for additional labour, $75 for taxes, and $500 for
additions to my &#8220;plant,&#8221; as I began to call my farm.
That made a total of $1,935, and left me a margin of
about $1,000 for food, wines, liquors, and cigars, magazines,
rare etchings, first editions, golf club dues, golf
balls, caddy hire, an automobile, some antique mahogany,
a few Persian rugs, an Italian marble sundial, and
several other trifles I desired.</p>

<p>I scanned my pad thoughtfully, and finally decided
not to join the golf club till the following year.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to me that I ought, of course, to
sell my farm produce for a handsome profit. Bert had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
gone to bed, so I couldn&#8217;t ask him how much I would be
likely to realize. But with all due conservatism I decided
that I could safely rejoin the golf club. So I did,
then and there. Whereupon I felt better, and, picking
out the manuscript of a novel from my bag, I went
bravely at the task of earning my living.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a id='link_3'></a>Chapter III<br /><span class='h2fs'>NEW JOY IN AN OLD ORCHARD</span></h2>

<p>The following morning was a balmy and exquisite
first of May, but realism again compels me to confess
that, having been an English instructor for seven years,
and having read manuscripts the night before till 2 <span class='sc'>a.m.</span>,
I did not leap lightly from my couch at the breakfast
call, nor did I sing ecstatically, as I looked from
my window:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><i>&#8220;Im wundersch√∂nen Monat Mai.&#8221;</i></p>
</div>

<p>What I actually did was to curse to myself at having
to clean my teeth in bitterly cold water, something I
have always loathed. Nor was I greatly cheered by
Mrs. Temple&#8217;s coffee. The New England farmer&#8217;s wife
can cook everything but coffee. But there seems to
be something in that simple art which completely baffles
her. Perhaps the coffee has something to do with
it!</p>

<p>Her cheery face, however, was not long to be resisted,
and Bert hustled me off immediately after the
meal to meet Hard Cider Howard, whom, by some rural
wireless, he had already summoned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>As we walked down the road, I glanced toward my
lone pine, and saw my horse and Mike&#8217;s hitched to the
plough, with Joe driving and Mike holding the handles.
Across the green pasture, between the road and the hayfield,
already four rich brown furrows were shining up to
the sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mike didn&#8217;t wait long!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;I
wonder why he started in there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him to,&#8221; said Bert. &#8220;That&#8217;s goin&#8217; ter be yer
pertater crop this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; said I. &#8220;Why?&#8221; I felt a little peeved.
After all, this was <i>my</i> farm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cuz it&#8217;s pasture land thet&#8217;s good fer pertaters, an&#8217;
yer don&#8217;t need it fer the cows, an&#8217; it kin be worked ter
give yer a crop right off, even though &#8217;twant ploughed
under in the fall,&#8221; Bert answered. &#8220;You trust yer
Uncle Hiram fer a bit, sonny.&#8221;</p>

<p>I blushed at my own peevishness, and thanked him
humbly. At the house we found awaiting a strange-looking
man, small, wrinkled, unkempt, with a discouraged
moustache and a nose of a decidedly brighter hue
than the rest of his countenance. He was tapping at
the sills of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about it, Hard? Cement?&#8221; said Bert.</p>

<p>Hard Cider nodded to me, with a keen glance from
his little, bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Stucco over it. Brick underpinnin&#8217;s
be ez good ez noo. Go inside.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>We stepped upon the side porch, Bert handing me
the key and I opening the door of my new dwelling
with a secret thrill. Hard Cider at once began on the
kitchen floor, ripping up a plank to examine the timbers
beneath. There was no cellar under the kitchen,
but the timbers were, like those of the barn, huge beams
of hand-hewn oak, and were sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plane them planks down and lay a maple floor over
&#8217;em,&#8221; said Hard, with an air of finality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said I meekly. &#8220;But my woodwork has
got to be cypress in the living-room. I insist on cypress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;New step,&#8221; he added, as we came to the door up into
the main house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; said I. &#8220;This door leads into the front
hall. I don&#8217;t want that. I want this door closed up
and put into the north room, which I&#8217;m going to use for
a dining-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter eat in the kitchen, eh? Very well,&#8221;
said Hard. He examined the old door frame carefully,
and jotted something in a dirty notebook, which he
drew from his pocket, first wetting his flat carpenter&#8217;s
pencil on his tongue.</p>

<p>We found that the north room had apparently been
used only as a kind of storage closet, doubtless because
there was no heater in the house. It had never been
papered, and the walls, with a little touching up, were
ready for kalsomining. Hard examined the plaster
with the loving eye of a connoisseur.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>&#8220;Built ter last in them days,&#8221; I heard him mutter.</p>

<p>The room extended half the depth of the house,
which, to be sure, was not great. Beyond it was a
second room, on the northeast corner, of the same
size.</p>

<p>We now crossed the hall to the south side, where
there were two corresponding rooms. Here, as on the
other side, the chimney and fireplaces were on the inside
walls, and the mantels were of a simple but very good
colonial pattern, though they had been browned by
smoke and time to dirt colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I want these two rooms made into one,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;I want one of the doors into the hall closed up, and
a glass door cut out of the south side to a pergola veranda.
Can you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hard examined the partition. He climbed on a box
which we dragged in, and ripped away plaster and woodwork
ruthlessly, both at the top and at places on the
sides, all without speaking a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;ef yer don&#8217;t mind a big crossbeam
showin&#8217;. She&#8217;s solid oak. Yer door, though, &#8217;ll
have to be double, with a beam in the middle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;One to go in by, one to go out.
Guests please keep to the right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hev ter alter yer chimney,&#8221; he added, &#8220;or yer&#8217;ll
hev two fireplaces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine again!&#8221; cried I. &#8220;A long room with two fireplaces,
and a double-faced bookcase coming out at right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
angles between them, with two settles below it, one for
each fireplace! Better than I&#8217;d dreamed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suit yerself,&#8221; said Hard.</p>

<p>We next arranged tentatively for a brick veranda
with a pergola top on the southern end of the house,
and then went upstairs. Here the four small chambers
needed little but minor repairs and plaster work, save
that over the dining-room, which was to be converted
into the bathroom. The great space over the kitchen
was to be cut into two servants&#8217; bedrooms, with dormer
windows. It already had the two windows, one to the
north and one to the south, and had evidently been used
as a drying-room for apples and the like. Hard figured
here for some time, and then led us silently downstairs
again, and through the front door.</p>

<p>My front doorway had once been a thing of beauty,
with two little panel windows at the sides, and above
all, on the outside, a heavy, hand-carved broken pediment,
like the top of a Governor Winthrop highboy.
Hard looked at it with admiration gleaming in his eyes.
&#8220;I&#8217;d ruther restore this than all the rest o&#8217; the job,&#8221; he
said, and his ugly, rumsoaked little face positively shone
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; said I; &#8220;only I want the new steps of
brick, widely spaced, with a lot of cement showing between.
I&#8217;m going to terrace it here in front, too&#8211;a
grass terrace for ten feet out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s right, thet&#8217;s right!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
I&#8217;ll go order the lumber, an&#8217; bring yer the estimate termorrer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me the usual proceeding would be the other
way around!&#8221; I gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yer want me ter do the job, don&#8217;t yer? Or
don&#8217;t yer?&#8221; he said brusquely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, of course!&#8221; I amended hastily. &#8220;Go
ahead!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hard climbed into a broken-down wagon, and disappeared.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry,&#8221; said Bert. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see he
treats yer right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; I said sadly. &#8220;It&#8217;s that I&#8217;ve just
remembered I forgot to include any painters&#8217; bills in
my own estimate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bert looked at me in a kind of speechless pity for a
moment. Then he said slowly: &#8220;Wal, I&#8217;ll be swizzled!
Wait till I tell maw! An&#8217; her always stickin&#8217; up fer a
college education!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just for that, I&#8217;ll show you!&#8221; cried I. &#8220;I never
trimmed an apple tree in my life, but I&#8217;m going to work
on this orchard, and I&#8217;m going to save it, all myself.
It will be better than yours in three years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to it,&#8221; laughed Bert. &#8220;Come back fer dinner,
though. Neow I&#8217;ll drive over ter the depot an&#8217; git
yer freight. They telephoned this mornin&#8217; it had come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;You might bring me a bag of
cement, too, and a gallon of carbolic acid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye ain&#8217;t tired o&#8217; life so soon, be yer?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I, &#8220;but I&#8217;m going to show you rubes how
to treat an orchard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bert went off laughing, and presently I saw him driving
toward town with his heavy wagon. I walked up to
the plateau field to greet Mike. As I crested the ridge
the field lay before me, the great, lone pine standing
sentinel at the farther side; and half of it was frail,
young green, and half rich, shining brown.</p>

<p>&#8220;She ploughs tough, sor,&#8221; said Mike, as the panting
horses paused for breath, &#8220;but she&#8217;ll harrer down good.
Be the seed pertaters come yit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bert has gone for them,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Let me hold
the plough once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike, I fancied, winked at his son Joe, who was a
strong lad of twenty, with an amiable Irish grin. So
everybody was regarding me as a joke! Well, I was,
even then, as strong as Mike, and I&#8217;d held a sweep, if
not a plough! I picked up the handles and lifted the
plough around, setting the point to the new furrow.
Joe started the horses. The blade wabbled, took a mad
skid for the surface, and the handles hit me a blow in the
ribs which knocked my breath out. Mike grinned. I
set my teeth and the ploughshare, and again Joe started
the horses. Putting forth all my strength I held the
plough under the sod this time, but the furrow I ploughed
started merrily away from the straight line, in spite
of all my efforts, and began to run out into the unbroken
ground to the left. I pulled the plough back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
again to the starting-point, and tried once more. This
trip, when I reached the point where my first furrow
had departed from the straight and narrow way, the
cross strip of sod came over the point like a comber
over a boat&#8217;s bow, and the horses stopped with a jerk,
while the point went down and again the handles smote
me in the ribs.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t so azy as it looks,&#8221; said Mike.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it if I haven&#8217;t a rib left,&#8221; said I grimly.</p>

<p>And I did it. My first full furrow looked like the
track of a snake under the influence of liquor, but I reversed
the plough and came back fairly straight. I was
beginning to get the hang of it. My next furrow was
respectable, but not deep. But on the second return
trip I ploughed her straight, and I ploughed her deep,
and that without exerting nearly so much beef as on
the first try. Most things are easy when you once
know how.</p>

<p>On this return trip the sweat was starting from my
forehead, and the smell of the horses and of the warm,
fresh-turned earth was strong in my nostrils. I didn&#8217;t
look at my pine, nor think of book plates. I was proud
at what I had done, and my muscles gloried in the toil.
Again I swung the plough around, and drove it across
the field, feeling the reluctant grass roots fighting every
muscle of my arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said I, triumphantly, &#8220;you plough all the
rest as deep as that!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>&#8220;Begobs, ye&#8217;z all right!&#8221; cried Mike.</p>

<p>I went back again down the slope with all the joy of
a small boy who has suddenly made an older boy recognize
his importance. I went at once to the shed, found
a rusty saw (for my pruning saws, of course, had not
yet come), and descended upon the orchard. I had a
couple of bulletins on pruning in my pocket, with pictures
of old trees remorselessly headed down. I took
a fresh look at the pictures, reread some of the text
where I had marked it, and tackled the first tree, carefully
repeating to myself: &#8220;Remove only a third the
first year, remove only a third the first year.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, I decided, quite naturally did not refer to dead
wood. By the time I had the dead wood cut out of
that first old tree, and all the water spouts removed
(as I recalled my grandfather used to call them), which
didn&#8217;t seem necessary for new bearing wood, the poor
thing began to look naked. On one side an old water
spout or sucker had achieved the dignity of a limb and
shot far into the air. I was up in the tree carefully
heading this back and out when Bert came driving by
with his wagon heaped to overflowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi!&#8221; he called, &#8220;yer tryin&#8217; ter kill them trees entire!&#8221;</p>

<p>I got down and came out to the road. &#8220;You&#8217;re a fine
man and a true friend, Mr. Temple,&#8221; said I, &#8220;but I&#8217;m
going to be the doctor for this orchard. A chap&#8217;s got
to have <i>some</i> say for himself, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>&#8220;Well, they ain&#8217;t much good, anyhow, them trees,&#8221;
said Bert cheerfully.</p>

<p>We now fell to unloading the wagon. We opened
up the woodsheds and storehouse behind the kitchen,
stowed in the barrels of seed potatoes, the fertilizers,
the various other seeds, the farm implements, sprayers,
and so on. The hotbed frames and sashes were
put away for future use, as it was too late to need them
now. The horse hoe Bert had not been able to bring
on this trip. Next we got my books and furniture into
the house or shed, and tired, hot, and dirty, we drove
on up the road for dinner. As we passed the upper
field, I saw that the ploughing was nearly done. The
brown furrows had already lost their gloss, as my hands
had already lost their whiteness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a farmer now!&#8221; said I, surveying my soil-caked
boots and grimy clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer on the way, anyhow,&#8221; said Bert. &#8220;But yer&#8217;ll
have ter cultivate thet field hard, seein&#8217;s how it oughter
hev been ploughed last fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>That afternoon I went back to my orchard, got out
my shiny and sharp new double-edged pruning saw,
and sawed till both arms ached. I sawed under limbs
and over limbs, right-handed and left-handed, standing
on my feet and on my head. I obeyed the first rule, to
saw close to the trunk, so the bark can cover the scar.
I obeyed the rule to let light into the tops. I didn&#8217;t
head my trees down as much as the pictures indicated,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
for I wanted my orchard before the house as a decoration
quite as much as a source of fruit supply. One old
tree, split by a winter storm, I decided to chop down
entirely. About half-past three, as I supposed it to be,
I went for an axe, and heard Mike putting the horse into
the barn and calling the cows. I looked at my watch.
It was five o&#8217;clock! I didn&#8217;t get the axe, but walked
back and surveyed the havoc I had wrought&#8211;dead
limbs strewing the ground, bright-barked water spouts
lying among them, tangles of top branches heaped high,
and above this litter three old trees rising, apparently
half denuded, with great white scars all over them where
the limbs had been removed. I had gone that first
day across half the top row of the orchard, and I suddenly
realized that during the entire time I had been
at work not a thought had crossed my mind except
of apple trees and their culture. I had been utterly
absorbed, joyfully absorbed, in the process of sawing
off limbs! Where, said I to myself, are those poetic
reflections, those delicious day dreams which come, in
books, to the workers in gardens? Can it be that, in
reality, the good gardener thinks of his job? Or am I
simply a bad gardener?</p>

<p>I decided to go to the barn and ask Mike. I found
him washing his hands, preparatory to milking, and
looking extremely bored. He used an antiseptic solution
which Bert had provided, for Bert was still buying
my milk.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s silly rules they be makin&#8217; now about a
little thing like milkin&#8217;,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t ready to argue with him then, but I secretly
resolved that I&#8217;d make him wear a milking coat, also.
I asked abruptly: &#8220;Mike, what do you think about
when you are working in the garden?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike reflected quite seriously for a full moment,
while the alternate ring of the milk streams sang a tune
on the bottom of the pail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Begobs, Oi niver thought o&#8217; that before,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s interestin&#8217; to think what ye think about.
Oi guess Oi thinks mostly o&#8217; me gardenin&#8217;. It ain&#8217;t till
Oi straightens the kink out o&#8217; me back and gits me
lunch pail in the shade that Oi begins to wonder if
the Dimicrats &#8217;ll carry the country or why we can&#8217;t go
sivin days without a drink, like the camels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sort of have to keep your mind on your job, to
do it right, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, if ye&#8217;ve got one to keep,&#8221; Mike laughed.</p>

<p>The milk streams had ceased to ring. They were
sizzling now, for the bottom of the pail was covered.
There was a warm smell of milk in the stable, and of hay
and cattle. Through the little door at the end I saw
framed a pretty landscape of my pasture, then woods
rising up a hill, and then the blue mountains, purpling
now with sunset. My arms ached. My ribs, where
the plough handles had hit, were sore. I was sleepily,
deliciously, tired. I had done a real day&#8217;s work. I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
rather proud of it, too, proud that I could stand so much
physical toil. After all, it is human to glory in your
muscles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; I called to Mike, as I started for
home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, sor,&#8221; he sang cheerily back.</p>

<p>Upon the plateau I saw my rusty old disk harrow&#8211;a
legacy from Milt&#8211;standing on the brown earth. The
furrows had disappeared. The field was almost ready
for planting. I took a bath, rubbing my ribs and aching
shoulders very tenderly, ate my supper hungrily,
and settled down to my manuscripts. In ten minutes
I was nodding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; said I, &#8220;this will never do! I&#8217;ll
have to get up in the morning and work.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I bade Mrs. Temple wake me when she got up at
five.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I reflected, as I tumbled into bed, &#8220;you
can&#8217;t have everything and a country estate, too. Fancy
<i>me</i> getting up at five o&#8217;clock!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span><a id='link_4'></a>Chapter IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>I PUMP UP A GHOST</span></h2>

<p>As A matter of fact, I didn&#8217;t. I went to sleep again
at five, and slept till seven. It&#8217;s not nearly so easy as
it sounds in books to change all your habits of life.
But I resolved to try again the next morning, and meanwhile
to keep awake that night at all costs. Then,
after breakfast, I set out for my farm. Hard Cider
would be there with the estimate. The rest of that
row of orchard was waiting for me. Mike and Joe
would finish harrowing the potato field and begin planting.
I almost ran down the road!</p>

<p>What is there about remodelling an old house, renovating
an old orchard, planting a fresh-ploughed field,
even building a chicken coop, which inspires us to such
enthusiasm? I have written a few things of which I
am not ashamed, and taken great joy in their creation.
But it was not the same joy as that I take in making
even one new garden bed, and not in the least comparable
to the joy of those first glorious days when my old
house was shaping up anew. It has often seemed to
me almost biological, this delight in domestic planning
both inside and outside of the dwelling&#8211;as though it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
were foreordained that man should have each his own
plot of earth, which calls out a primal and instinctive
√¶stheticism like nothing else, and is coupled with the
domestic instinct to reinforce it. I have known men
deaf and blind to every other form of beauty who
clung with a loyal and redeeming love to the flowers
in their dooryard.</p>

<p>As I came into my own dooryard, I found Hard
Cider unloading lumber. He nodded briefly, and
handed me a dirty slip of paper&#8211;his estimate. Evidently
he, too, had paternally taken me over, for this
estimate included the plumber&#8217;s bill for a heater, the
water connections for house and barn, a boiler on
the kitchen range, and the bathroom. The bill would
come to $3,000. That far exceeded my own estimate,
and I had still the painters to reckon with! However,
Hard&#8217;s bill seemed fair enough, for Bert had told me the
price of lumber, and there was a lot of digging to connect
with the town main. I nodded &#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; and
opened the door. In three minutes he and his assistant
were busily at work.</p>

<p>In the woodshed I found Mike cutting up the seed
potatoes into baskets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good mornin&#8217;,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Joe&#8217;s got the tooth
harrer workin&#8217;, and we&#8217;ll be plantin&#8217; this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>I started then toward the orchard, only to meet
the boss plumber arriving. With him I went down
cellar to decide on the position for the heater. &#8220;Of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
course you&#8217;re going to have hot water?&#8221; said the
boss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; said I. &#8220;I loathe radiators. They spoil
the rooms. Wouldn&#8217;t you, as a great concession, let
me have old-fashioned hot air?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can have anything you want, of course,&#8221; the
plumber replied, being, like most of his kind, without a
sense of humour, &#8220;but to get register pipes upstairs in
this old house you&#8217;ll spoil your rooms more than with
radiators. We have some very ornamental radiators.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no such animal,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>But I ended with hot water. There were to be four
radiators downstairs and three upstairs, one in the
bathroom, one in the hall, and one in a chamber. The
other chambers, having fireplaces, I decided needed no
further heat, though the plumber was mournfully
skeptical. That made seven in all, and did not call
for a large heater. After much dickering and argument,
the plumber consented to leave the old copper
pump at the sink, in addition to the faucets. I refused
to let that pump go, with its polished brass knob on the
iron handle, even though the sink was to be replaced
by a porcelain one. As the bathroom was almost over
the kitchen, and as the house already had a good cesspool,
by some happy miracle, the work was comparatively
simple, and the plumber left to get his men and
supplies.</p>

<p>Again I started for the orchard. Already the buds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
were swelling on the old trees, and the haze of nascent
foliage hung over them. I had four and a half rows to
trim, and then the whole orchard to go over with paint
pot and gouge and cement. I had never trimmed a tree
in my life till the day before, yet I felt that I was doing a
better job than Bert had done on his trees, for Bert&#8217;s
idea of pruning was to cut off all the limbs he could
reach near the trunk, often leaving a stub four inches
long when it didn&#8217;t happen to be convenient to saw
closer. He made his living, and a good one, selling
milk and cauliflowers&#8211;he had thirty acres down to
cauliflowers, and shipped them to New York&#8211;but, like
so many New England farmers, he couldn&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t
understand the simple science of tree culture. Anybody
can learn tree culture with a little application to
the right books or models and a little imagination
to see into the future. A good tree pruner has to be
a bit of an architect. I thought so then in my pride,
at any rate, and it turned out I was right. Right or
wrong, however, I went at my job that morning with
a mighty zest, and soon had a second barrier of dead
wood heaped upon the ground.</p>

<p>As I worked, I thought how this orchard must be
trimmed and cleaned up first, but how the fine planting
weather was upon us, too, and I ought to be getting
my garden seeds in, if I was to have any flowers. I
thought, also, of all my manuscripts to be read. A nervous
fit seized me, and I worked frantically. &#8220;How on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
earth shall I ever find time for all I&#8217;ve got to do?&#8221; I
said to myself, sending the saw into a dead limb with
a vicious jab. But I soon discovered that nervous
haste wasn&#8217;t helping any. In my excitement, I cleaned
off all the suckers on a limb, and suddenly realized
that I should have left two or three of the strongest to
make new wood, as the limb itself was past bearing. I
thought of Mike&#8217;s reflection, that he kept his thoughts
on his gardening. So I calmed down, and gave my
whole attention to my work, making a little study of
each limb, deciding what I wished to leave for future
development, and what would give the best decorative
effect to my slope as well. You can really trim an old
apple tree into a thing of gnarled power and quaint
charm by a little care.</p>

<p>Tap, tap, tap, came the sound of hammers from my
house. The plumbers had returned, and I could hear
them rattling pipes. The water company was digging
for the connections. Now and then a shout from Joe
to the horses was wafted down from the plateau. A
pair of persistent song sparrows, building in an evergreen
by the brook, kept up a steady song. A robin
sang in the next tree to me. The sun beat warmly on
my neck. And I sawed and pruned, keeping steadily
to my job, treating each tree and limb as a separate
and important problem, till I heard the hammers cease
at noon.</p>

<p>I had almost completed my first row!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>As I returned from dinner, Joe was walking the drills
in the potato field, dropping the fertilizer, and the bent
form of Mike followed immediately behind him, dropping
the seed from a basket. Joe walked with a fine,
free stride, and dropped the fertilizer from his hand with
a perfectly rhythmic gesture. The father&#8217;s bent back
behind him was an added touch from Millet. But the
lone pine and the blue mountains gave a bright, sharp
quality to the landscape which was quite unlike Millet.
The picture held me, however, as do the Frenchman&#8217;s
canvases. Even my knowledge of Mike&#8217;s comfortable
home and happy disposition did not rob it of that subtle
pathos of agricultural toil. Why the pathos, I asked
myself? Mike is healthy and happy. No toil is more
healthful. I&#8217;m working as hard as Mike, and having a
glorious time! To be sure, I&#8217;m working my own land,
but Mike, too, has a garden of his own, yet doubtless
looks as pathetic in it. I could find no solution, unless
it be that instinctive belief of a city-bred civilization
that all joys are urban. Just then, however, Mike
straightened up with a laugh, and the pathos vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the pathos,&#8221; thought I, as I caught myself instinctively
straightening, too, &#8220;is a matter of spinal
sympathy!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a most comforting reflection, and I hastened
to investigate Hard Cider&#8217;s morning work. The kitchen
floor was ready to relay. Over the old planking he had
spread tar paper, then carefully adjusted a light,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
half-inch framework, and on top of this was laying the new
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;ll keep out the cold,&#8221; he said briefly, carefully
lifting the lid of the stove and spitting into the
fire pot.</p>

<p>I examined the framework on which he was laying
the new floor. It was as carefully jointed as if it were
the floor itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so much pains with this?&#8221; I asked, pointing
with my toe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Hard Cider replied, as the March Hare
replied to Alice.</p>

<p>I was braver than Alice. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t show,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody might take the floor up,&#8221; he retorted,
with some scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard Cider, after all, is an artist,&#8221; I thought. &#8220;He
has the artistic conscience&#8211;and, being a Yankee, he
won&#8217;t admit it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went back to my orchard, working with a greater
confidence and speed now, born of practice; and I had
begun on the second row by five o&#8217;clock. Then I
walked up to the plateau. Joe was working overtime,
covering the drills, while his father was doing the stable
work. I staked the three sections of the field containing
Early Rose, Dibble&#8217;s Russet, and Irish Cobbler
respectively, and entered in my notebook the
date of planting. It occurred to me then and there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
to keep a diary of all seeds, soils, fertilizers, and plantings,
noting weather conditions and pests during the
growing season, and the time, quality, and quantity of
harvest. That diary I began the same evening; I have
kept it religiously ever since, and I have learned more
about agriculture from its pages than from any other
book&#8211;something I don&#8217;t say vainly at all, because it
is but the careful tabulation of practical experience, and
that is any man&#8217;s best teacher.</p>

<p>I picked up a hoe and helped Joe cover drills for half
an hour. Thanks to golf and rowing, my hands were
already calloused, or I don&#8217;t know what would have
happened to them in those first days!</p>

<p>Then I walked back to my house. I could not bring
myself to leave it. I walked down through the littered
orchard to the brook, and planned out a cement dam
and a pool. Then I walked back to the south side of
the dwelling, and looked out over the slope where my
main vegetable farm was to be. The land had been
ploughed close up to the house. It would be easy to
level it off for a hundred feet or more into a grass terrace,
with a rose hedge at the end to shut out the farm,
and a sundial in the centre. To the east it would go
naturally into an extension of the orchard; to the west it
would end at a grape arbour just beyond the farthest
woodshed. I would place my garden hotbeds against
the sheltered south side of the kitchen, and screen them
with a bed of hollyhocks running west from the end of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
the main house, which extended in a jog some twelve or
fifteen feet beyond the kitchen. Thus one end of my
pergola veranda would naturally run off into a hollyhock
walk, the other into the grassy slope of the orchard,
while directly in front of the glass door would be
the lawn, the sundial, and then a white bench against
the rambler hedge. I saw it all as I stood there, saw
it and thrilled to it as a painter must thrill to a new
conception; thrilled, also, at the prospect of achieving
it with my own hands; thrilled at the thought of dwelling
with it all my days. I must have remained there a
long time, lost in reverie, for I was very late to supper,
and Mrs. Temple was not so cheerful as her wont.</p>

<p>That night I managed to keep awake till eleven, and
got some work done. I also rose at a compromise hour
of six in the morning, and worked another hour, almost
catching up with what should have been my daily stint.
But I realized that hereafter I could not work on the
farm all day. I must give up my mornings to my manuscript
reading.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; thought I, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it&#8211;as soon as the orchard
is finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the orchard was finished! I stood amid
the litter I had made on the ground, and reflected. I
had completed the preliminary trimming of one row
and part of a second. There were still over two rows
and a half to do. And the worst trees were in those
rows, at that. After they were trimmed, there was all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
the litter to clear out, and the stubs to be painted, and
cement work to be done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; thought I, &#8220;if I do all that, when
will I plant, when will I make my lawn?&#8221;</p>

<p>Were you ever lost in the woods, so that you suddenly
felt a mad desire to rush blindly in every direction,
helpless, bewildered, with a horrid sensation that your
heart has gone down somewhere into your abdomen?
That is the way I suddenly felt toward my farm. I
couldn&#8217;t afford to employ more labour. Besides, I
didn&#8217;t want to. I wanted to do the work myself. But
there was so much to do!</p>

<p>I stood stock still and pulled myself together. &#8220;Rome
was not built in a day,&#8221; I told myself. &#8220;You just take
out the worst of the dead wood in those remaining
trees now, and finish them another season, or else at
odd times during the summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then one of those things called a still, small voice
whispered in my ear: &#8220;But you should never begin a
new job till you have finished the old. Hoe out your
row, my son!&#8221;</p>

<p>I recognized the latter words as the catch phrase of
a moral story in an ancient reader used in my boyhood
school days. Oh, these blighting dogmas taught us in
our youth! I resisted the still, small voice, but I felt
secretly ashamed. That day I finished the orchard by
merely taking out unsightly dead wood and a few of
the worst suckers; so that one half of it looked naked and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
one half bearded, even as the half-shaved hunchback
in the &#8220;Arabian Nights.&#8221; I knew I was doing right,
yet I felt I was doing wrong, and in my heart of hearts I
was never quite happy for a year, till I had that orchard
finished.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hard Cider had finished the kitchen floor
and cut out the new door frame into the dining-room,
while the plumbers had mounted the boiler by the
range and begun on the piping. Mike and Joe had
been busy on the slope to the south, ploughing the most
distant portion for the fodder crops and harrowing in
load after load of old stable manure from the barn. The
next day would bring them into the garden area, so I
staked out my contemplated sundial lawn, allowing a
liberal 250 feet, and ran the line westward till it came
a trifle beyond the last woodshed, whence I ran it north
to the shed for the grape arbour. West of the arbour,
on the half acre of slope remaining before the plateau
was reached, I planned to set out a new orchard&#8211;some
day. That same night I filled out an order for fifty
rambler roses! &#8220;I&#8217;ll grow &#8217;em on poles, till I can build
the trellises,&#8221; said I. Then I sat down to my manuscripts.</p>

<p>The next morning I managed to prod myself out of
bed at five-thirty, and found that I could do more work
before breakfast than in three hours in the evening.
I must confess I was a little annoyed at this verification
of a hoary superstition. Personally, I like best to work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
at night, and some day I shall work at night again. It
is a goal to strive for. But you cannot drive your
brain at night when you&#8217;ve been driving your body all
day. That, alas! is a drawback on farming.</p>

<p>Reaching my farm at eight, I found Joe harrowing in
manure on the garden and Mike sowing peas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I have the horse to-morrow?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yez cannot,&#8221; said Mike. &#8220;Sure, we&#8217;ll be another
day at the least gettin&#8217; the garden ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want to grade my lawn,&#8221; I said. &#8220;The day
after, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said Mike. &#8220;Yez must make lawns when
there&#8217;s nothin&#8217; else at all to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; I replied, and he grinned.</p>

<p>That sundial lawn had now taken possession of
my imagination. My fingers fairly itched to be at it.
I lingered fondly on the rough furrowed slope as I
crossed to the orchard, and saw a rambler in pink or
red glory at each of my stakes, climbing a trellis and
making a great, outdoor room for my house. I stepped
into the house straightway, and told Hard Cider to order
the trellis lumber for me.</p>

<p>Then I went at my orchard. Armed with a gouge, a
mallet, a bag of cement, a barrowful of sand, a box
for mixing, a trowel, and a pail of carbolic solution, I
gouged out a few&#8211;only a few&#8211;of the worst cavities
in the old trunks, washed them, and filled them with
cement. It was a slow process, that took me all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
morning, and I fear it was none too neatly done, for I
had never worked in cement before. Moreover, I will
admit that I got frightened at my inexperience, and
confined my experiments to three or four cavities. But
it was extraordinarily interesting. I found a certain
childish fascination in the similarity of the work to a
dentist&#8217;s filling teeth. If every tree died, I told myself,
I would still have been repaid in the fun of doing the job
myself. Early in the afternoon I started to paint the
scars where limbs had been removed, but changed my
mind suddenly, and decided to clean up the litter on the
ground first. The orchard looked so disgusting. So
for more than three hours I sawed and chopped, chopped
and sawed, carted wheelbarrow load after wheelbarrow
load of firewood to the shed, and load after load of
brush and dead stuff to a heap in the garden. Still the
rake brought up more litter from the tangled grass (for
the orchard had not been mowed the year before), and
still I trundled the barrow back for it.</p>

<p>When six o&#8217;clock came I was still carting from the top
of the orchard, and for an hour past I had been working
with that grim automatism which characterizes the
last lap of a two-mile race. There is no joy of creation
in clearing up! It is just a grind. And yet it is a part
of creation, too, the final stage in the achievement
of garden beauty. I wonder if any gardener exists,
though, with the imagination so to regard it while he
cleans? Certainly I am not the man. I then and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
there resolved to finish the job by installments, from
day to day. Perhaps, taken a little at a time, it would
not seem so boresome!</p>

<p>The next morning the smoke of my burning brush
pile was coming over the hill as I drew near my farm.
The harrow was at work in the garden. Hard&#8217;s hammer
was ringing from the chamber over the dining-room,
which he was converting into a bathroom so that
the plumbers could get to work in it. The old orchard
trees held up their cropped and denuded tops with a
brave show of buds, and I debated with myself what
I should do. &#8220;Spray!&#8221; I decided. So I got a hoe, and
started to scrape the trees mildly on the trunks and
large lower limbs, while my lime-sulphur mixture was
boiling on the stove. I soon found that here, again, I
had tackled a job which would require a day, not an
hour, so I gave it up, and put the solution in my spraying
barrel, summoned Joe to the pump, and sprayed
for scale on the unscraped bark. I was by this time
getting used to half measures. You have to, when you
try to bring up a farm with limited labour!</p>

<p>The wiseacre has now, of course, foreseen that I
killed all the young buds. Alas! I am again compelled
to spoil a good story, and confess that I didn&#8217;t kill any
of them. I mixed the lime-sulphur one part to sixty, for
I carefully read the warning in my spraying bulletin.
I have my doubts whether it was strong enough to kill
the scale, certainly not with the bark left on, but at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
least it was weak enough not to kill the buds, and it was
fun applying it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; I cried, as noon came, &#8220;the orchard may
rest for the present! Now for the next thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Have you ever watched a small boy picking berries?
He never picks a bush clean, but rushes after this or
that big cluster of fruit which strikes his eye, covering
half an acre of ground while you, perhaps, are stripping
a single clump of bushes. And he is usually amazed
when your pail fills quicker than his. Alas! I fear
I was much like that small boy during my first season on
the farm, or at any rate during the first month or two.
There was little &#8220;efficiency&#8221; in my methods&#8211;but, oh,
much delight!</p>

<p>I fairly gobbled my dinner, and rushed back, a fever
of work upon me. Seed beds, that was what I wanted
next. As I had planned to put my garden coldframes
along the south wall of the kitchen, I decided to make
my temporary seed beds there. Mike assented to the
plan as a good one, and I had him dump me a load of
manure, while I brought earth from the nearest point
in the garden, spaded up the soil, mixed in the garden
earth and dressing, and then worked and reworked it
with a rake, and finally with my hands.</p>

<p>Ah, the joy of working earth with your naked hands,
making it ready for planting! The ladies I had seen in
their gardens always wore gloves. Even my mother, I
recalled, in her little garden, had always worn gloves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
Surely, thought I, they miss something&#8211;the cool, moist
feel of the loam, the very sensations of the seeds themselves.
At four o&#8217;clock I had my bed ready, and I got
my seed packets, sorted them in a tin tobacco box, and
began to sow the seeds. The directions which I read
with scrupulous care always said, &#8220;press the earth
down firmly with a board.&#8221; I was working with a flat
mason&#8217;s trowel, so I got up and found a board. It
wasn&#8217;t half so easy to work with, but I was taking no
chances!</p>

<p>&#8220;There must,&#8221; I grinned, &#8220;be some magic efficacy
in that board.&#8221;</p>

<p>The seeds were not my own selection. They had
been chosen for me by Professor Grey&#8217;s assistant. That,
I confess, was a cloud on my pleasure. Half the fun in
sowing flower seeds comes from your hope of achieving
those golden promises held out by the seed catalogues&#8211;like
a second marriage, alas! too often &#8220;the triumph of
hope over experience&#8221;&#8211;or else from your memory of
some bright bed of the year before.</p>

<p>But the cloud was a small one, after all. I sat in the
afternoon sun, beneath my kitchen windows, opening
little packets of annuals with grimy fingers that turned
the white papers brown, and gently, lovingly, put the
seeds into the ground. I had no beds as yet to transplant
them to; very often I didn&#8217;t know whether they
could be transplanted. (As it turned out, I wasted all
my poppy seeds.) But I was in no mood to wait. As
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
each little square was sown, I thrust the packet on a
stick for a marker, and hitched along to the next square.
Bachelors&#8217; buttons, love-in-a-mist, Drummond&#8217;s phlox,
zinnias, asters, stock, annual larkspur, cosmos, mignonette
(of course I lost all that later, as well as the poppies),
marigolds, nasturtiums, and several more went
into the soil. My border seeds, the sweet alyssum
and lobelia, I had sense enough not to plant, and
I sowed none of the perennials. But what I put in was
enough to keep a gardener busy the rest of the summer.
Then I got my new watering-pot, filled it at the kitchen
sink, and gently watered the hopeful earth.</p>

<p>Mike and Joe were unhitching the horse from the
harrow as I finished. The great brown slope of the
vegetable garden, lying away from the house toward the
ring of southern hills, was ready for planting. There
was my farm, thence would come my profits&#8211;if profits
there should be. But just at that moment the little
strip of soaked seed bed behind me was more important.
It stood for the colour box with which I was going to
paint, for the fragrant pigments out of which I should
create about my dwelling a dream of gardens.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;a country place is but half
realized without its garden, even though it be primarily
a farm; and the richness of country living is but half
fulfilled unless we become painters with shrub and tree
and flower. I cannot draw, nor sing, nor play. Perhaps
I cannot even write. But surely I can express
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
myself here, about me, in colour and landscape charm, and
not be any the worse farmer for that. I have my work;
I shall write; I shall be a farmer; I shall be a gardener&#8211;an
artist in flowers; I shall make my house lovely
within; I shall live a rich, full life. Surely I am a happy,
a fortunate, man!&#8221;</p>

<p>I put the watering-pot back in the shed, crossed the
road to the old wooden pump by the barn on a sudden
impulse, and pumped water on my hands and head, for
I was hot. Mike stood in the barn door and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are yez doin&#8217; that for?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>I stood up and shook the water from my face and
hair. &#8220;Just to be a kid, I guess,&#8221; I laughed.</p>

<p>There are some things Mike couldn&#8217;t understand.
Perhaps I did not clearly understand myself. In some
dim way an old pump before a barn and the shock of
water from its spout on my head was fraught with
happy memories and with dreams. The sight of the
pump at that moment had waked the echo of their mood.</p>

<p>But as I plodded up the road in the May twilight to
supper, one of those memories came back with haunting
clearness&#8211;a summer day, a long tramp, the tender
wistfulness of young love shy at its own too sudden passion,
the plunge of cool water from a pump, and then at
twilight half-spoken words, and words unspoken, sweeter
still!</p>

<p>The amethyst glow went off the hills that ring our
valley, and a far blue peak faded into the gathering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
dusk. A light shivered off my spirit, too. I felt suddenly
cold, and the cheery face of Mrs. Temple was the
face of a stranger. I felt unutterably lonely and depressed.
My farm was dust and ashes. That evening
I savagely turned down a manuscript by a rather well-known
author, and went to bed without confessing
what was the matter with me. The matter was, I had
pumped up a ghost.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span><a id='link_5'></a>Chapter V<br /><span class='h2fs'>I AM HUMBLED BY A DRAG SCRAPER</span></h2>

<p>One of the advantages of being a bachelor when you
are building or restoring a house is that you can spend
most of your time in the garden. I am by nature a
trusting soul anyway (which no woman and possibly
no wise man ever is where carpenters, builders, and
plumbers are concerned), and I trusted Hard Cider
implicitly. He told me the plumbers were &#8220;doin&#8217; all
right,&#8221; and I believed him. That he himself was doing
all right my own eyes told me, for he had by now
reached the south rooms, removed the dividing partition,
revealing the old, hand-hewn oak beam at the top,
and was cutting a double door out in the centre on
either side of the great oak upright, toward my future
sundial lawn. I stood in this new door, looking back
at my twin fireplaces, with their plain-panelled old
mantels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Howard,&#8221; said I, &#8220;those mantels are about as
plain as you could make &#8217;em, and yet they are very
handsome, somehow, dingy as they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the lines,&#8221; said Hard Cider. &#8220;Jest the right
lines. Lower &#8217;em six inches, and whar&#8217;d they be?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>&#8220;Could you build me a bookcase, against the wall,
just like them, from one to the other and bring it out
at right angles five feet into the room from the centre,
making it the back of a double settle?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a carpenter,&#8221; Hard replied laconically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you draw me what it would look like first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t said I wuz an artist,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Draw
it yerself.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took his proffered pencil, and sketched what I
wanted on a clean board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer got too much curve on the base and arms o&#8217;
them settles,&#8221; he said judicially. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t no curves in
your mantels. You want &#8217;em square, with a panel
like them over your fireplaces.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the pencil away from me, and made a quick,
neat, accurate sketch of just what I instantly saw I did
want.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>I shrugged my shoulders. &#8220;Go ahead!&#8221; said I.
&#8220;What did you ask me to draw it for in the first place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Folks likes to think they hev their own idees,&#8221; he
answered.</p>

<p>I turned away, through the new south door, into the
May sunshine. The pergola was not commenced. In
fact, I had decided not to build it till the following
spring. Those beastly painters whom I had forgotten
were going to eat up too much of my slender capital.
Before me stretched the 250 feet of ploughed slope
which was to be my sundial lawn. At the end of it
was my line of stakes where the ramblers were to climb.
Beyond that was the vegetable garden, newly harrowed
and fertilized, where Mike and Joe were busily working,
the one planting peas, the other setting out a row of
beets. The horse was not in evidence. I could have
him at last, to make my lawn! I ran around the house
to the stable, clumsily put on his harness, for I was not
used to horses, led him to the shed where my tools were
stored, hitched him to my new drag scraper, and drove
him to the slope.</p>

<p>As I have said, the ground here sloped down eastward
toward the brook, and if I was to have a level
lawn south of my house, I should have to remove at
least two feet of soil from the western end and deposit
it on the eastern end. I wisely decided to start close to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
the house. Hauling at the handles of the heavy scraper
and yelling &#8220;Back up, there!&#8221; at the horse, I got the
steel scoop into the ground at the line of my proposed
grape arbour, tipped down the blade, and cried, &#8220;Giddup!&#8221;
I hung to the reins as best I could, twisting
them about my wrist, and the horse started obediently
forward. The scoop did its work very nicely. In fact,
it was quite full after we had gone six feet, and I
had only to let the horse drag it the remaining ninety-four
feet of the proposed width of the lawn, and empty
it. Then I went back, and repeated the process.
After five repetitions of the same process, the perspicacious
reader will have reckoned that I had shaved
off something less than half the width of my lawn, on
one furrow, and was still a long, long way from being
down to the required depth of two feet at the higher
end. My arms already ached. As the scraper covered
a furrow but two feet wide, that meant 125 furrows to
scrape my entire lawn as planned, and at least twenty
trips to the furrow. I did some rapid multiplication as
I paused to wipe my brow. &#8220;Twenty times 125 is
2,500,&#8221; thought I. I dropped the reins and moved
toward my stakes. I saw that Joe and Mike were looking
at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said I, with some dignity, as I began to
pull the stakes up, &#8220;that this lawn will look better
square. As it&#8217;s a hundred feet broad, a hundred feet
will be far enough to extend it from the house.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Mike, &#8220;the big road scraper &#8217;ll be over
here to-morrow, scrapin&#8217; the road, and it do be easier
an&#8217; quicker to borry that.&#8221;</p>

<p>In some ways, I consider this remark of Mike&#8217;s, under
the circumstances, one of the most gentlemanly I ever
heard! And I jumped at his suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit this job is bigger than I
thought. How can I borrow the road scraper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, ain&#8217;t me frind Dan Morrissy one o&#8217; the selictmen?&#8221;
said Mike, &#8220;and ain&#8217;t he the road boss, and ain&#8217;t
he willin&#8217; to earn an extra penny for&#8211;for the town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; said I; &#8220;for the town! Well, I&#8217;ve got to have
this lawn! You get your friend Dan in the morning.
Just the same, I don&#8217;t love the town so much that I
want a 250-foot lawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took my line of stakes back 150 feet, and replanted
them. That gave me a more intimate lawn, like a
large outdoor south room, I thought. It also increased
my vegetable garden acreage. I returned to the scraper
and the patient horse with a new humbleness, a new realization
of what one man cannot do in a day. That,
perhaps, is one of the first and most important lessons
of farming and gardening. Once you have learned it,
you are either discouraged or fired anew with the persistence
of patience. I was not discouraged. Besides,
I had Mike&#8217;s friend Dan, the selectman, to fall back on!
It is always well to be friends with Tammany Hall.
First, I decided not to grade even my smaller lawn to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
dead level, but merely to smooth it off, letting that
process counteract the slope as much as it would. Then
I started to scoop again, bringing down the soil from
the higher western side directly to the south face of my
house and dumping it there, to be packed into a terrace
which next season should be the floor of my pergola.</p>

<p>Did you ever try to handle a drag scraper and drive
the horse at the same time, dear reader? It requires
more muscle and as much patience as golf. Joe offered
to come and drive for me, but I preferred him to plant,
and kept on by myself. It is amazing how much dirt
you can dump in one place without increasing the
pile perceptibly. The only thing more amazing is the
amount of dirt you can take out of one place without
perceptibly increasing the depth of your hole. I ran
the scoop along the edge of my proposed grape arbour
time after time, dumping the contents in front of my
new south door, but still that first furrow didn&#8217;t sink
more than six inches, and still the sills of my house rose
above the piles. Noon came and found me with aching
arms and strained shoulder sockets. I had brought
some lunch, to save the walk back to Mrs. Temple&#8217;s,
and I took it into my big south room to eat it. Hard
was in there eating his. The plumbers were eating
theirs in the new kitchen, already completed.</p>

<p>Hard, I found, had begun the bookcase, which was
just the height of the mantels. He had been preparing
the top moulding with his universal plane when noon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
came, and the sweet shavings lay curled on the floor.
I scuffed my feet in them, and even hung one from my
ear, as children do, while Hard Cider regarded me scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have great times in this room!&#8221; I
exclaimed. &#8220;Books between the fireplaces, books
along the walls, just a few pictures, including my Hiroshiges,
over the mantels, my desk by the west window,
and out there the green garden! A man ought to write
something pretty good in this room, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hard looked at me with narrowed eyes. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know nothin&#8217; about writin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it &#8217;pears to
me a feller could write most anywhar pervided he had
somethin&#8217; ter say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon Hard concluded by biting into a large
piece of prune pie.</p>

<p>The Yankee temperament is occasionally depressing!
I went outdoors again, eating my doughnuts as I walked,
and strolled into the vegetable garden to survey the
staked rows which denoted beets and peas. Then I
went down the slope into my little stand of pines, into
the cool hush of them, and unconsciously my brain
relaxed in the bath of their peace, and for ten minutes I
lay on the needles, neither asleep nor awake, just blissfully
vacant. Then I returned to my scooping, marvellously
rested.</p>

<p>I scooped till three o&#8217;clock, led the horse back to the
barn, got a shovel and rake, and began to spread my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
terrace. As this south end of my house (and accordingly
my big south room) was but thirty-three feet long,
the task was not very severe, particularly as the upper,
or western, end, did not require much grading. I built
the terrace out about twelve feet from the wall, stamped
up and down on it to pack it, and raked it smooth. I
realized that it would settle, of course, and I should
need more earth yet upon it before it was sown down to
grass, or, if I could afford it, bricked; but in order to
hold the bank, I got some grass seed and planted the
edge, and also got a couple of planks to stretch from the
south door across the terrace and down to the lawn,
until I could build my proposed brick path and steps.
It was six o&#8217;clock when I had finished. Palm-sore and
weary, I drank a great tin dipperful of water from my
copper pump in the kitchen, took a last look at Hard&#8217;s
bookcase, which had already been built out the required
five feet into the room along the line of the old partition,
fourteen inches wide to hold books on both sides, tried
the doors to see that they were locked, and tramped up
the dusty road to supper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple was beaming when I came down from
my bath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so happy?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said she, &#8220;in the first place, I&#8217;ve got you the
housekeeper I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By which I infer that she&#8217;s the one <i>I</i> want, too?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mrs. Temple, on whom irony had
no effect. &#8220;She&#8217;s Mrs. Pillig, from Slab City, and she&#8217;s
an artist in pies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on; you interest me strangely!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Is
her husband dead, and has she got a small boy?&#8221; (Here
I winked at Bert.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Pillig ain&#8217;t dead, worse luck,&#8221; said Mrs. Temple,
&#8220;but he&#8217;s whar he won&#8217;t trouble you. I guess Peter
won&#8217;t trouble you none, neither. He&#8217;s a nice boy, and
he&#8217;ll be awful handy round the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter Pillig!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no such
animal! If there is, Dickens was his grandfather. How
old is Peter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter&#8217;s eleven,&#8221; Mrs. Bert replied. &#8220;He&#8217;s real
nice and bright. His mother&#8217;s brought him up fine.
Anyhow, she was a Corliss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, eugenically speaking, Peter may have a predisposition
to follow in father&#8217;s footsteps, which I
infer led toward the little green swinging doors,&#8221; I protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speakin&#8217; U. S. A., tommyrot!&#8221; said Mrs. Temple.
&#8220;Anyhow, it&#8217;s the door o&#8217; the drugstore in this town.
They sell more&#8217;n sody water down to Danforth&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I to pay the author of Peter and the pies?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, seein&#8217;s how you keep Peter, as it were, and
Mrs. Pillig calc&#8217;lates she can rent her house up to Slab
City, she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to come to you for $20 a month. She&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
wuth it, too. You&#8217;ll have the best kept and cleanest
house in Bentford.&#8221;</p>

<p>I rose from the table solemnly. &#8220;Mrs. Temple,&#8221; said
I, &#8220;I accept Mrs. Pillig, Peter, and the pies at these
terms, but only on one condition: <i>She is never to clean
my study!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said I, &#8220;you can never tell where an
orderly woman will put things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bert chuckled as he filled his pipe. Mrs. Temple
grinned herself. I was about to make a triumphant
exit, when these words from Mrs. Temple&#8217;s lips arrested
me:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bert,&#8221; she said, &#8220;did you clean the buggy to-day?
You know you gotter go over ter the deepot to-morrow
an&#8217; git that boarder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That <i>what?</i>&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bert&#8217;s eyes half closed with a purely feminine delight.
&#8220;Oh, ain&#8217;t I told you?&#8221; she said innocently.
&#8220;We&#8217;re goin&#8217; ter hev another boarder, a young lady.
From Noo York, too. Her health&#8217;s broke down, she
says, only that&#8217;s not the way she said it, and somehow
she heard of us. We ain&#8217;t never taken many boarders,
but I guess our name&#8217;s in that old railroad advertisin&#8217;
book. I wouldn&#8217;t hev took her, only I thought maybe
you wuz kind o&#8217; lonesome here with jest us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Temple,&#8221; said I, &#8220;your solicitude quite overwhelms
me. Comfort me with petticoats! Good Lord!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
And an an√¶mic, too! I&#8217;ll bet she has nerves! When
can Mrs. Pillig come to me, woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bert&#8217;s eyes closed still farther. &#8220;Oh, your
house ain&#8217;t near ready yet,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why, the
painters ain&#8217;t even began.&#8221;</p>

<p>I fled to my chamber, and hauled forth a manuscript.
A female boarder! No doubt she&#8217;d expect me to shave
every day and change my working clothes for the noonday
dinner! Heavens! probably she&#8217;d come down and
advise me how to lay out my garden! So far, I had
been blissfully free from advice. I had gone to the
village just once&#8211;to open my account at the bank. I
had not met a soul in the town. One or two of the
early arrivals on the estates had driven by in their cars
and stared curiously, but I had ignored them. I didn&#8217;t
want advice. I was having fun in my own way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang Mrs. Temple!&#8221; I muttered, reading a whole
paragraph of manuscript without taking in a word of it.
In fact, I gave up all attempt to work, and crossly and
wearily went to bed, where I lay on one of my strained
shoulders and dreamed that a sick female with spectacles
was hauling at my arm and begging me to come and
rescue her sciatic nerve, which had fallen into my not-yet-built
garden pool and was being swallowed by a
gold fish.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span><a id='link_6'></a>Chapter VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE HERMIT SINGS AT TWILIGHT</span></h2>

<p>The next morning I demanded that Mrs. Temple
again put me up some lunch. &#8220;For,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to postpone meeting this broken-down wreck of
a perhaps once proud female as long as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe when you see her drive by you&#8217;ll be sorry,&#8221;
Mrs. Bert smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be working on the south side of the house,&#8221; I
retorted.</p>

<p>I had not been long at my place, indeed, I had
scarcely finished watering my seed bed and carting out
my daily stint of two barrow loads of slash from the
orchard, when I heard the road scraper rattling over the
bridge by the brook. Mike came from the vegetable
garden and met his &#8220;frind Morrissy,&#8221; to whom I was
ceremoniously presented.</p>

<p>The scraper was a large affair with flat-tired iron
wheels and a blade eight feet long. It was drawn by
four horses, and Mr. Morrissy himself was driving, while
a younger man manipulated the levers. We drove in
behind the woodshed to the proposed lawn, I explained
what I wanted done, and the scraper went to work, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
me trotting anxiously alongside, quite useless but convinced
that I was helping, like Marceline at the Hippodrome.
The way that eight-foot blade, with four horses
hauling it, peeled off the old furrows and brought the
top soil down from the high side to the low made my
poor efforts with the scoop look puny enough. After
a few trips it began to look as if my lawn could be
fairly level after all. Where I had worked an hour to
lower the ground six inches, the scraper accomplished
the same result in five minutes and on four times as wide
a strip. I soon saw, too, that Mike and Joe were useless
in the garden, so long as &#8220;frind Morrissy&#8221; and his
helper were here on the lawn, so I set them to spreading
the loose dirt at the lower end, as fast as the scraper
brought it down, taking a hand myself. The lawn was
shaping up so fast that I began once more to grow expansive.</p>

<p>&#8220;It really won&#8217;t be square,&#8221; thought I, &#8220;because my
pergola will cut off twelve feet of the length, and if I
have flower beds by the roses, they&#8217;ll cut off some more.
I guess those roses ought to be 112 feet from the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>I threw down my shovel, went over to the row of
stakes, and moved them south again, twenty-five feet,
having added thirteen feet as I walked; then I called
out to &#8220;frind Morrissy&#8221; to bring his scraper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Mike, &#8220;you&#8217;ll get it right yet. But I
was goin&#8217; to put me cauliflowers there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scraper went at the new twenty-five foot strip, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
in an hour that, too, was down eight inches at the west
end and up as much at the east. The lawn still sloped,
and though an afternoon with the scraper could probably
have put it nearly level, and I was tempted to have
it done, Mike pointed out that we were already getting
perilously close to the subsoil, and if we went deeper
we&#8217;d get into tough sledding, and I&#8217;d end, besides, by
getting a surface which wouldn&#8217;t grow grass. So I took
his advice, paid &#8220;frind Morrissy&#8221;&#8211;for the town!&#8211;as
the far-off noon whistle at Slab City blew, and took my
lunch down to the brook while the scraper rattled off
down the road.</p>

<p>The brook reminded me of the pool I was going to
build, and the pool of my dream, and my dream of the
new boarder, and then with the patness of a &#8220;well-made&#8221;
play the boarder herself entered, as it were.
That is, I heard the buggy coming, and the voice of
Bert. I lay down flat behind the tall weeds and grasses,
and remained hidden till the buggy had passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confounded petticoats!&#8221; thought I. &#8220;Well, if she
tries to advise me, I&#8217;ll snub her so she won&#8217;t try a second
time!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I finished my lunch, and lay for a quarter of an
hour lazily regarding the sky, a great blue sky with cloud
ships floating at anchor in its depths, while the indescribable
fragrance of May in moist places filled my
nostrils and a song sparrow practised in the alders. As
I got up to return to my work, I saw suddenly that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
old apple trees in my orchard were showing pink&#8211;just
a frail hint of it in the veil of young green. A great
cumulus cloud piled up like a Himalayan peak in the
west beyond my mouse-gray dwelling. To the left,
the new lawn was shiny brown, and as I climbed the
slopes the smell of it came to me. Out still farther to
the left my land was already staked in rows of packed
earth, neatly. The scene was beautiful to my eyes, and
the imagined beauty of to-morrow made me almost
run through the orchard to leave my lunch basket
in the kitchen and get my tools for the afternoon&#8217;s
work.</p>

<p>I had, unfortunately, no roller, but I found in the
shed an old piece of tattered carpet, which I tacked on a
ten-foot beam, tied a rope to each end, united the two
ropes around a stick for a handle, and dragged this improvised
smoother back and forth over my lawn, as I
had seen the keepers of the dirt tennis courts at college
do. It was really surprising how well this smoothed the
surface, especially at the lower end where the dirt was
loose. It had much less effect on the ground where the
scraper had taken off the top soil. After the lawn
looked tolerably level to the eye, I brought three loads
of manure from the barn, scattered them lightly, and
went over the surface with a light tooth harrow. I saw
I was not going to get the lawn done that afternoon, for
it would have to be &#8220;rolled&#8221; again. I further realized,
as the horse sank into the loose soil at the lower side,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
that I should have to wait till a rain had settled the
earth before I resmoothed it, and could sow my grass
seed. At five o&#8217;clock, as Joe was leaving the garden,
and Mike had gone to the barn to milk the cows, I, too,
put up my tools, resolved to enjoy an hour&#8217;s loaf&#8211;my
first since I bought the farm!</p>

<p>I scrubbed my hands and face at the kitchen sink in
a tin basin which recalled my childhood, took a long
draught from the tin dipper, filled my pipe, and strolled
down through the budding orchard toward the brook.
The song sparrow was still singing. The cloud ships
were still riding at anchor. Even with my pipe in my
mouth I could smell the odour of moist places in May.
Walking beside the brook, I suddenly found the green
spears of an iris plant amid the grasses. A few steps
farther on, under the maples, the ground was blue and
white with violets and anemones. Then the brook entered
the pines, lisping a secret as it went, and I followed
it into their cool hush.</p>

<p>I had gone scarcely six paces when I heard the crackle
of footsteps on dead twigs somewhere ahead of me, and
a moment later the vague form of a woman was visible
making her way amid the impeding dead branches. I
stood still. She did not see me till she was close up.
Then she gave a slight start and said, &#8220;I beg your pardon.
I trust I am not trespassing.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at her, while my pipe bowl was hot in my
calloused hand. She was scarce more than a girl, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
fancied, pale and unmistakably not of this country
world. I cannot say how she was dressed, save that
she wore no hat and looked white and cool. But I saw
that she had very blue eyes on each side of a decidedly
tilted nose, and these eyes were unmistakably the kind
which twinkle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trespassing is a relative term,&#8221; said I, after this, I
fear, rather rudely prolonged scrutiny.</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk like &#8217;Hill&#8217;s Rhetoric,&#8217;&#8221; she smiled, with a
quick glance at the incongruity of my clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;It was the text-book I
formerly used with my classes.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a little upward gurgle of laughter from the
girl. &#8220;Clearness, force, and elegance, wasn&#8217;t that the
great triumvirate?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something like that, I believe,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I am trying
to forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And are these pines yours to forget in? It should
be easy. I was walking out there in the road, and I
spied the brook over the wall and climbed through the
briers to walk beside it, because it was trying so hard to
talk to me. That was wrong of me, perhaps, but I
never could resist a brook&#8211;nor pine trees. They are
such nice old men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;are the little virgin birches
always running away from them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes contracted a second, and then twinkled.
&#8220;The birches <i>plague</i> them,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>&#8220;How do they plague them?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull their pine needles when they are asleep, of
course,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Thank you for letting me
walk here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said I, &#8220;it is always a pleasure to entertain
a true naturalist.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled, and made to pass on. I stood a little
aside, in silence. And in that moment of silence suddenly,
from near at hand, from somewhere in these very
pines, there rang out the golden throb of a hermit thrush
so close that the grace notes of his song were audible,
cool and liquid and lovely. The suddenness, the nearness,
the wildness of this song made it indescribably
thrilling, and the girl and I both stood rigid, breathless,
peering into the gloom of the pines. Again the call
rang out, but a little farther away this time, more plaintive,
more fairylike with distance. She took a step as
if to follow, and instinctively I put out my hand, grasping
her arm to restrain her. So we stood and waited,
while from farther still, evidently from the tamaracks
in the corner of my lot, came the elfin clarion. The
singer was a good one; his attack was flawless, and he
scattered his triplets with Mozartian ease and precision.
Still we waited, in silence, but he did not sing again.
Then in a kind of wonder the girl turned her face to
mine, and in a kind of wonder I realized that I was still
holding her arm. She appeared as unconscious of it as
I, till I let my hand fall. Then she coloured a little,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
smiled a little, and said, &#8220;What was it? I never heard
anything so beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A hermit thrush,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Thoreau once
described his song as &#8217;cool bars of melody from the
everlasting morning or evening.&#8217; I think that expresses
it as well as words can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always wanted to hear a hermit,&#8221; she said
wistfully. &#8220;And, oh, it is lovelier than I dreamed! I
am going now before I get too jealous of you for having
one all your own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go!&#8221; I said impulsively. &#8220;The hermit has
never sung for me. That song must have been in your
honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment when I stood holding her arm, the moment
when she had turned her wondering, eager face to
mine, had been very pleasant. It was dusk now in the
pines, and, looking westward, the low sun was making
daggers of light between the trees. My ghost that I
had brought up from the pump suddenly walked again,
but walked in flesh and blood, with blue eyes and tilted
nose. I was undeniably affected. My voice must have
betrayed it as I repeated, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I fear it is time for my supper,&#8221; she said, with
a little nervous laugh. &#8220;The thrush has evidently gone
for his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Birds eat early,&#8221; said I. &#8220;They have to, because
they get up so early, after that worm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her laugh was once more an up-gushing gurgle. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
tenseness was broken. I found myself walking by her
side through the maples, and pointing out my house.</p>

<p>She clapped her hands ecstatically. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;they made the front door out of a highboy! How
jolly! Is it as nice inside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be nicer,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Come and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll peep through the windows,&#8221; she smiled.</p>

<p>I led her to my new south door, proudly showing my
new lawn and the terrace, and telling her where the
roses were to be, and the sundial, and dilating on the
work my own hands had done. With a silly, boyish
enthusiasm, I even displayed the callouses and invited
her to feel of them, which she did as one humours a
child, while I thrilled quite unchildishly at the touch
of her finger tips. Then we peeped through the glass
doors. The low sun was streaming in through the
west window and disclosed the old oak beam across
the ceiling. Hard Cider had erected the frame of the
bookcase and double settle, which would perfectly match
the mantels as soon as the molding was on. One side of
the settle faced toward one smoky old fireplace, the
other toward the second.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two fireplaces! What luxury!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said I, &#8220;when I get tired of reading philosophy
at the east fireplace, I&#8217;ll just come around the
corner and read &#8217;Alice in Wonderland&#8217; at the west
chimney nook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Double fireplaces&#8211;twin fireplaces&#8211;twin fires!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
That&#8217;s it, Twin Fires! That ought to be the name of
your house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right!&#8221; I cried, delighted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never
been able to think of a name. That&#8217;s the inevitable
one&#8211;that&#8217;s Flaubert&#8217;s one right word. You must
come to my christening party and break a bottle of
wine on the hearth.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled wistfully, as she turned away from the
window. &#8220;I must surely go to supper,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Good-bye, and thank you for your wonderful concert.&#8221;</p>

<p>We walked to the road, but to my surprise she did not
turn toward the village but toward Bert&#8217;s. A sudden
light came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the broken-down boarder?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>The gurgle welled up, and the blue eyes twinkled,
but she made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just for that,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I won&#8217;t carry back Mrs.
Bert&#8217;s basket.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we entered the Temple&#8217;s yard, Mrs. Bert stood in
the kitchen door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you two seem to have got acquainted,&#8221; she
remarked in a matter-of-fact tone. &#8220;Miss Goodwin,
this is Mr. Upton I told you about. Mr. Upton, this
is Miss Goodwin I told you about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Temple,&#8221; said I, &#8220;you are another. You
didn&#8217;t tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; she retorted, &#8220;where&#8217;s my basket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I left it behind&#8211;on purpose,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll hev ter come home to yer dinner to-morrow,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m willing,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you be,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>At supper she returned to the theme, which appeared
to amuse her endlessly. &#8220;Miss Goodwin,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I want ter warn you thet Mr. Upton&#8217;s terrible afraid
somebody&#8217;s goin&#8217; ter advise him how ter build his garden.
He&#8217;s a regular man.&#8221;</p>

<p>I replied quickly: &#8220;Your warning is too late,&#8221; said
I; &#8220;Miss Goodwin has already begun by naming my
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can change the name, you know,&#8221; the girl
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I?&#8221; I answered, with great sternness.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the right one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon I went up to my work, and listened to the
sounds of soft singing in the room across the hall.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span><a id='link_7'></a>Chapter VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GHOST OF ROME IN ROSES</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Stella Goodwin.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s rather a pretty name,&#8221;
I thought, as I read it on the flyleaf of a volume she
had left in Mrs. Bert&#8217;s sitting-room. The volume itself
amused me&#8211;Chamberlain&#8217;s &#8220;Foundations of the Nineteenth
Century.&#8221; Fancy coming to the country for a
rest, and reading Chamberlain, most restless because
most provocative of books! I was waiting for breakfast,
impatiently, having been at work on my manuscripts
since five. Mrs. Bert was in the kitchen; Bert
was at the barn. The hour was seven-thirty. I was
idly turning the leaves of Chamberlain when there was
a rustle on the stairs, and Miss Stella Goodwin entered
with a cheerful &#8220;Good morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; said I, &#8220;what are you doing with this
book, if you are off for a rest? This is no book for a
nervous wreck to be reading.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who said I was a nervous wreck?&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;I&#8217;m just tired, that&#8217;s all. I guess it&#8217;s really spring
fever. I saw a spear of real grass in Central Park, and
ran away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From what?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>&#8220;From the dictionary,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>which?</i>&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dictionary. Would you like me to sing you a
song of the things that begin with &#8217;hy&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed again, and began to chant in burlesque
Gregorian, &#8220;Hyopotamus, hyoscapular, hyoscine, Hyoscyame√¶,
hyoscyamine, Hyoscyamus<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>-&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;You will have me hypnotized.
See, I&#8217;m on the &#8217;hy&#8217;s&#8217; myself! Please explain&#8211;not
sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;you see it&#8217;s this way. I have
to eat, drink, and try to be merry, or to-morrow I die, so
to postpone to-morrow I am working on a new dictionary.
<i>Somebody</i> has to work on dictionaries, you know,
and justify the pronunciation of America to man. I&#8217;m
sort of learned, in a mild, harmless, anti-militant way.
It isn&#8217;t fair to keep the truth from you&#8211;<i>I have a degree
in philology!</i> My doctor&#8217;s thesis was published by the
press of my kind University, at $1.50 per copy, of which
as many as seventeen were sold, and I&#8217;m still paying up
the money I borrowed while preparing it. I stood the
dictionary pretty well down to the &#8217;hy&#8217;s,&#8217; and then one
day something snapped inside of me, and I began to
cry. That wouldn&#8217;t have been so bad, if I hadn&#8217;t made
the mistake of crying on a sheet of manuscript by a
learned professor, about Hyoscyamus (which is a genus
of dicotyledonous gamopetalous plants), and the ink
ran. Then I knew I should have to take a rest in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
cause of English, pure and well defined. So here I am.
The doctor tells me I must live out of doors and saw
wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;God has sent you! I shall get
my orchard cleaned up at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Breakfast!&#8221; called Mrs. Bert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Goodwin,&#8221; I announced at that meal, &#8220;is
going to saw up the dead wood in my orchard this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she ain&#8217;t. The idee!&#8221; cried Mrs. Bert. &#8220;She&#8217;s
jest goin&#8217; ter rest up for the next four weeks, an&#8217; grow
fat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are both wrong,&#8221; laughed the young lady.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to begin on Mr. Upton&#8217;s wood pile this
morning, but I expect to finish it before I go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If thet&#8217;s how you feel, <i>I</i> got a wood pile,&#8221; said Bert.</p>

<p>She refused to come down to Twin Fires with me that
morning, so I toiled alone, getting out more of the brush
from the orchard&#8211;all of the small stuff, in fact, which
wasn&#8217;t fit to save for fuel. In the afternoon she consented
to come. As I looked at her hands and then at
mine, I realized how pale she was.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wrong for anybody to be so pale as that,&#8221; I
thought, &#8220;to <i>have</i> to be so pale as that!&#8221;</p>

<p>I was beginning to pity her.</p>

<p>When we reached the farm, I took her around under
the kitchen window and showed her my seed beds,
where the asters were already growing madly, some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
other varieties were up, and the weeds were busy, too;
but in the present uncertainty of my horticultural
knowledge I didn&#8217;t dare pull up anything. I hadn&#8217;t
realized till that moment that half the fun of having a
new place is showing it to somebody else and telling
how grand it is going to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where are you going to put these babies when
you set them out?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the point,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.
I want you to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After Mrs. Bert&#8217;s warning, I shouldn&#8217;t dare advise
you,&#8221; she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s ask Hiroshige,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he your gardener? The name sounds quite un-Hibernian.&#8221;</p>

<p>I scorned a reply, and we went around to the shed
where all my belongings were stored, still unpacked.
I got a hammer and opened the box containing pictures,
drawing forth my two precious Japanese prints.
Then I led Miss Goodwin through the kitchen in spite
of her protests of propriety, through the fragrance of
new flooring, into the big south room, where Hard had
nearly completed his main work and was getting in
the new door frames while his assistants were patching
up the floor. She sat down on the new settle, while
I climbed on a box and hung the pictures, one over each
mantel. Instantly the room assumed to my imagination
something of its coming charm. Those two spots
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
of colour against the dingy wood panels dressed up the
desolation wonderfully. I hastily kicked some shavings
and chips into the fireplaces and applied a match.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first fires on the twin hearths!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;In
your honour!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl smiled into my face, and did not joke.
&#8220;That is very nice,&#8221; she said. Then she rose and put
out her hand. &#8220;Let me wish Twin Fires always plenty
of wood and the happiness which goes with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>We shook hands, while the fire crackled, and already
the spot seemed to me like home. Then she looked up
at the prints. &#8220;Now,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;how is honourable
Hiroshige going to advise you? Here is a blue canal
and a lavender sky in the west, and bright scarlet
temple doors&#8211;and all the rest snow. Lavender and
bright scarlet is rather a daring colour scheme, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if it&#8217;s the right scarlet,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;But it&#8217;s
not the colour I&#8217;m going to copy. Neither is it the
moon bridges in this other temple garden. It&#8217;s the
simplicity. Out here south of this room is my lawn
and garden. Now I want it to be a real garden, but I
don&#8217;t want it to dwarf the landscape. I don&#8217;t want it
to look as if I&#8217;d bought a half acre of Italy and deposited
it in the middle of Massachusetts, either. I&#8217;ve never
seen a picture of a real Japanese garden yet that didn&#8217;t
look as much like a natural Japanese landscape as a
garden. I want my garden to be an extension of my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
south room which will somehow frame the real landscape
beyond.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went through the glass door, and I showed her
where the grape arbour was to be, at the western side
of the lawn, and how a lane of hollyhocks would lead to
it from the pergola end, screening the kitchen windows
and the yet-to-be-built hotbeds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to build a rambler rose
trellis along the south; there&#8217;s your red against the
lavender of the far hills at sunset! But how shall the
trellis be designed, and where shall the sundial be, and
where the flower beds?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl clapped her hands. &#8220;Oh, the fun of planning
it all out from the beginning!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;My,
but I envy you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t envy; advise,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t know anything about gardens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know what you like! People always say
that when they are ignorant, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be nasty,&#8221; she replied, running down the
plank from the terrace to the lawn, and walking out to
the centre. &#8220;I&#8217;d have the sundial right in the middle,
where it gets all the sun,&#8221; she said, &#8220;because it seems
to me a dial ought to be in the natural focus point of the
light. Then I&#8217;d ring it with flowers, some low, a few
fairly tall, all bright colours, or maybe white, and the
beds not too regular. Then, right in line with the door,
I&#8217;d have an arch in the trellis so you could see through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
into the farm. Oh, I know! I&#8217;d have the trellis all
arches, with a bigger one in the centre, and it would look
like a Roman aqueduct of roses!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Roman aqueduct of roses,&#8221; I repeated, my imagination
fired by the picture, &#8220;walking across the end of
my green lawn, with the farm and the far hills glimpsed
beneath! &#8217;Rome&#8217;s ghost since her decease.&#8217; Miss Goodwin,
you are a wonder! But can you build it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;I can only give you the derivation
of &#8217;aqueduct&#8217; and &#8217;rose&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said I, &#8220;we will consult Hard Cider.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;Is that anything like
Dutch courage?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hard grunted, and came with us to the line of stakes
where the rose trellis was to be. I sketched roughly
the idea I wanted&#8211;a reproduction in simple trellis work,
as it were, of High Bridge, New York.</p>

<p>Hard pondered a moment, and then departed for
the shed. He returned with several pieces of trellis
lumber, a spade, some tools, a small roll of chicken
wire, and a step-ladder, all on a wheelbarrow. At his
direction, I dug a post-hole at the extreme east end of
the lawn, another two feet away, a third four feet beyond
that, and a fourth again two feet to the west.
Hard then mounted the 3 x 3 chestnut joists, levelled
them as I set them, and connected the tops, leaving a
space for the next connection on the final post to the west.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is the arch?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>Hard climbed down from the wheelbarrow in silence,
cut off something over four feet from the three-foot
wide chicken wire, and then cut a circumference into
this wire which, in the centre, came within a foot of the
top. He twisted the loose ends back and tacked the
flat arch thus made to the top and inner posts of the
trellis. Then he connected the two posts on each side
with stripping. Thus I had the first arch of my aqueduct,
nine feet high, with two-foot piers of trellis work
and a four-foot arch with eight feet clear space under
the centre.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t pretty,&#8221; said Hard, &#8220;but when it&#8217;s painted
green and covered with vines it won&#8217;t show. Guess
most of your roses will bloom on the south side of it,
though, away from the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>My face fell. &#8220;Golly, I hadn&#8217;t thought of that!&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ll peep over and all around it,&#8221; said Miss
Goodwin cheerfully.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>&#8220;What could I have done else?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;, &#8217;cept turned your house around,&#8221; Hard
replied. &#8220;You can buy wire arches so&#8217;s you could
plant your roses east and west, but that wouldn&#8217;t give
you no level top like a bridge. You could set those
boughten arches on the south side of this trellis, though,
so&#8217;s you&#8217;d get the effect of something solid, lookin&#8217;
through, without losin&#8217; your top.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll get you paid first,&#8221; I laughed, as Hard
went back to his work.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; I added to the girl at my side, &#8220;shall we
see if <i>we</i> can build the next arch?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she clapped her hands delightedly, and ran
with me around the house for the tools and lumber.</p>

<p>I let her dig the first post-hole, though it was evident
that the effort tired her, and then I took the spade
away, while she marked off the trellis strips into the
proper lengths, and sawed them up, placing each strip
across the wheelbarrow and holding it in place first
with a hand which looked quite inadequate even for
that small task, and, when the hand failed, with her foot.</p>

<p>She laughed as she put her foot on the wheelbarrow,
hitching her skirt up where it bound her knee. &#8220;The
new skirts weren&#8217;t made for carpenters,&#8221; she said, as
she jabbed away with the saw. I darted a glance at
the display of trim ankles, and resumed my digging in
the post-holes. This was a new and disturbing distraction
in agricultural toil!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>The post-holes were soon dug, and while I held the
posts, she adjusted the level against them, our hands
and faces close together, and we both kicked the dirt
in with our feet. Then I climbed on the step-ladder
and levelled the top piece, which I nailed down. Then,
while I was cutting a semicircle out of the wire, for the
arch, she nailed the trellis strips across the piers, grasping
the hammer halfway up to the head, and frowning
earnestly as she tapped with little, short, jablike
blows. She was so intent on this task that I laughed
aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you laughing at?&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You drive a nail as if it were an
abstruse problem in differential calculus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, for me,&#8221; she answered, quite soberly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
suppose I&#8217;ve driven a dozen nails in my life&#8211;only tacks
in the plaster to hang pictures on. And it&#8217;s very important
to drive them right, because this is a rose
trellis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I first came here,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I was pretty
clumsy with my hands, too. I&#8217;d lost my technique, as
you might say. I remember one afternoon when I
was trimming the orchard that I didn&#8217;t think a single
thought beyond the immediate problem each branch
presented. And yet it was immensely stimulating.
Personally, I believe that the educational value of manual
dexterity has only begun to be appreciated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Goodwin marked off the place for the next strip,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
and started nailing. At the last blow she relaxed her
frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; she said. &#8220;No, probably. But the manual
work, it seems to me, has got to be connected up
in some way with&#8211;well, with higher things. I can&#8217;t
think of a word to fit, because my head is so full of the
&#8217;hy&#8217; group. You, for instance, were sawing your <i>own</i>
orchard, and you were working for better fruit, and
more beautiful trees, and a lovely home. You saw the
work in its higher relations, its relations to the beauty
of living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your nails?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see the aqueduct of roses,&#8221; she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see them, I trust,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You <i>shall</i>
see them. You must stay till they bloom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her brow suddenly clouded, and she shook her head.
&#8220;I&#8211;I shall have to go back to the &#8217;I&#8217;s,&#8217;&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But I shall know the roses are here. You must send
me a picture of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow I was less enthusiastic over the next arch,
but her spirits soon came back, and she sawed the next
batch of stripping with greater precision and skill in
the use of the saw&#8211;and a more reckless show of stocking.
&#8220;See!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;how much I&#8217;m improving!
I didn&#8217;t splinter any of the ends this time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You can tackle the firewood in the
orchard soon!&#8221;</p>

<p>We got up two more arches, working close together,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
intent upon our task. As each arch, with its piers,
took up eight feet, and the central arch would take
up twelve, we should need exactly a dozen arches
to complete the trellis. Here were four of them
done!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; cried the girl, as the fourth was finished.
&#8220;How we are getting on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could never have done it alone,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You
have really been a great help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope so!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had
so much fun in years.&#8221;</p>

<p>We looked into the vegetable garden, and saw that
Mike had gone, and Joe, too. My watch and the
lengthening shadows warned me it was approaching
six. Hot and pleasantly tired, we packed up the tools
on the barrow, and wheeled them to the shed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now shall we go and hear the hermit?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She nodded, and we went down through the orchard,
past the pool where the iris buds were already showing
a spike of greenish white, through the maples, and into
the pines. There we stood, side by side, in the quiet
hush of coming sunset, and waited for the fairy horn.
A song sparrow was singing out by the road, and the
thin, sweet flutings of a Peabody came from the pasture.
But the thrush was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please sing, Mr. Thrush!&#8221; she pleaded, looking at
me after she spoke, with a wistful little smile of apology
for her foolishness. &#8220;I want so to hear him again,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t hear thrushes in New York, nor smell
pine trees, nor feel this sweet, cool silence. Oh, the
good pines!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will sing to-morrow,&#8221; said I. &#8220;There is no
opera on Thursdays.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes twinkled once more. &#8220;Perhaps he has that
terrible disease, &#8217;sudden indisposition&#8217;,&#8221; she laughed.
&#8220;Come, we must go home to supper. It will take me
hours to get clean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out in the open, she looked at her hands. &#8220;See, I&#8217;ve
begun to get callouses, too!&#8221; she exclaimed, holding out
her palms proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got blisters,&#8221; said I. &#8220;No work for you
to-morrow! Let me see.&#8221;</p>

<p>I touched her hand, as we paused beneath a blossoming
apple tree, with the fragrance shedding about us.
Our eyes met, too, as I did so. She drew her hand
back gently, as the colour came to her cheeks. We
walked on in silence, as far as the pump. Mike had
finished milking, and had gone home. The stable was
closed. Inside, we could hear the animals stamp. Suddenly
I put my head under the pump spout, and asked
her to work the handle. Laughing, she did so, and as
I raised my dripping head, I saw her standing with the
low western sun full upon her, her eyes laughing into
mine, her nose and lips provocative, her plain blouse
waist open at the throat so that I could see the gurgle
of laughter rise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>&#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221; she asked, arrested, perhaps,
by something in my gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;there&#8217;s a ghost lives in this
well, and maybe with your aid I shall pump it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like the ghost?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much,&#8221; said I, as we climbed the slope to
Bert&#8217;s.</p>

<p>That evening Mrs. Bert sent her off to bed, and I
toiled cheerfully at my manuscripts till the unholy hour
of eleven.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span><a id='link_8'></a>Chapter VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>I PICK PAINT AND A QUARREL</span></h2>

<p>The next morning at breakfast a burned nose confronted
me across the table, and the possessor ruefully
regarded her sore palms.</p>

<p>&#8220;No work for you to-day,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You will just
have to pick out colours for me. The painters are
coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>I spoke as if we were old friends. I spoke as if it were
the most natural thing in the world for a young woman
to accompany a young man to his house and pick out
paint for him. I spoke, also, as if I had never cursed
the prospect of petticoats that advise. So soon can
one pair of eyes undo our prejudices, and so easily are
the conventions forgotten, in the natural life of the
country&#8211;at least by such persons as never were much
bothered by them, anyhow!</p>

<p>Evidently they had never greatly troubled Miss Goodwin,
or she was not disposed to let them trouble her
now, for ten minutes later we went down the road together,
and found the painters already unloading their
wagon. The reliable Hard Cider, true to his word, had
procured them for me, which, as I afterward have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
discovered, was something of a feat in Bentford, where
promises are more common than fulfilment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems a pity to paint the outside of the house,&#8221;
said Miss Goodwin; &#8220;it&#8217;s such a lovely weathered gray
now. What colour is it going to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No colour,&#8221; said I. &#8220;White, with green blinds, of
course. But the inside will be done first.&#8221;</p>

<p>We entered, with the boss painter, and went into the
south room, which had already become the natural
centre of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to paper any rooms if
I can help it. I want the walls calcimined. They look
pretty sound to me, barring some places where you&#8217;ll
have to patch the plaster. Can it be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>The painter walked about the room carefully, then
examined the hall, the north room, and the dining-room,
while the girl and I followed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; then I want this room done first, as I&#8217;m
anxious to get my books unpacked and my desk set up.
Now, what colour shall it be?&#8221; I turned toward Miss
Goodwin as I spoke.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to say a word,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;This is your room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you want the woodwork white?&#8221; the
painter suggested. &#8220;Those old mantels, for instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cream white, not dead white,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Wait a
minute.&#8221; I ran to the shed and brought back two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
more of my pictures, an etching by Cameron which our
professor of fine arts had once given me, and an oil
painting acquired in a moment of rash expenditure
several years before&#8211;the long line of Beacon Street
houses across the Charles with the church spires rising
here and there, and to the left Beacon Hill piling up to
the golden dome of the State House.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the walls have got to set off both
these pictures, and books besides. They&#8217;ve got to be
neutral. I want a greenish, brownish, yellowish olive,
with the old beam in the centre of the ceiling in the
same key, only a bit darker.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl and the painter both laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so definite,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want an indefinite tint,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>Again she laughed, though the painter looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get my colours,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He mixed what he considered an olive tint, and laid
a streak of it on the plaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too green,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>He added something and tried again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too gray,&#8221; said Miss Goodwin, forgetful, and then
quickly supplemented, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He added something else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too brown,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Once more he patiently mixed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too muddy coloured,&#8221; I corrected.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be fun to be a painter,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>&#8220;Oh, we get used to it,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try a little yellow,&#8221; I suggested. &#8220;I want that
tint warmed up a trifle.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did so, and something emerged which looked right
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a queer olive, though,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a greenish, brownish, yellowish olive,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; I replied. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I asked for! Do the
walls in this colour, and paint the woodwork, mantels,
and the panels over them and the bookcase and settles
a creamy white, with a creamy white on the ceiling, and
oil up this old floor and stain the strip of new boards
where the partition was, and my room is ready!&#8221;</p>

<p>We went into the little hall, where the front door
stood open, and we could see Hard on a ladder mending
the beautiful carved door cap outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;This hall the same colour,&#8221; said I, &#8220;with the rails of
the baluster in the cream white of the trim.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went into the northeast room and the dining-room
behind it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same colour here?&#8221; asked the painter.</p>

<p>I was about to answer yes, when Miss Goodwin spoke.
&#8220;I should think you&#8217;d want these rooms lighter in
colour,&#8221; she said, &#8220;as they face the north.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lady&#8217;s right,&#8221; said the painter.</p>

<p>&#8220;They always are,&#8221; I smiled. &#8220;You two fix up the
colour for this room, then. We can decide on the other
rooms after these downstairs are done.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; cried the girl, &#8220;I won&#8217;t do anything of the
kind! You might not like what I picked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Incredible!&#8221; said I. &#8220;I&#8217;ve really got to get to
work outside now.&#8221; And I ran off, leaving her looking
a little angrily, I thought, after me.</p>

<p>I was so impatient to see how my lawn was going to
look that I went to the shed to hunt up a dummy sundial
post which I could set up and mark off my beds
around it, getting them manured for planting. At first
I could find nothing, except some old logs, but looking
up presently into a loft under the eaves, I saw the
dusty end of what looked like a Doric pillar poking out.
I scrambled up and pulled forth, to my joy, a wooden
pillar about nine feet long, in excellent preservation.
How it got there, I had no idea. The dust had evidently
accumulated on it for years. It had once been
painted white. I dragged the heavy column down,
and ran to get Hard Cider.</p>

<p>He grunted. &#8220;All yer side porch pillars wuz them
kind when I wuz a boy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Old man Noble&#8217;s
fust wife didn&#8217;t like the porch&#8211;thought it kept light
out o&#8217; the kitchen, an&#8217; hed it took down. His second
wife hed it put back, but some o&#8217; the columns hed got
lost, or burnt up, I reckon, so&#8217;s they put it back with
them square posts yer hev now. I reckon that column&#8217;s
nigh on a century old.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sawed off the upper four feet carefully, and stowed
the remainder back in the loft. Then I made a square
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
base of planking, a temporary one till I could build a
brick foundation, washed off the dust, and took my
pedestal around to the lawn. With a ball of twine
tied to the centre of the south room door I ran a line
directly out to the rose trellis, and midway between the
trellis and where the edge of my pergola was to be I
placed the pillar. Then I took out my knife, and
thrust the blade lightly in at an angle, to simulate the
dial marker, and turned to call Miss Goodwin.</p>

<p>But she was already standing in the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, running lightly down the plank and
across the ground, &#8220;a sundial already, and a real pedestal!
Come away from it a little, and see how it seems
to focus all the sunlight.&#8221;</p>

<p>We stood off near the house, and looked at the white
column in mid-lawn. It did indeed seem to draw in the
sunlight to this level spot before the dwelling, even
though it rose from the brown earth instead of rich
greensward, and even though beyond it was but the unsightly,
half-finished, naked trellis. Even as we watched,
a bird came swooping across the lawn, alighted on my
knife handle, and began to carol.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the darling!&#8221; cried Miss Goodwin. &#8220;He understands!&#8221;</p>

<p>I was very well content. I had unexpectedly found
a pedestal, and was experiencing for the first time the
real sensation of garden warmth and intimacy and
focussed light which a sundial, rightly placed, can bring.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
I did not speak, and presently beside me I heard a voice
saying, &#8220;But I forgot that I am angry at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you had no right to leave me to pick out
the paint for your dining-room,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said I. &#8220;You picked out the name of
my house and the style of the rose trellis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was different,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are extremely stupid,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t help me
any to understand, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;and see if the paint suits you.
Then I must go home and write some letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>The paint and calcimine tint suited me, of course.
They were a warm, golden cream and a very delicate
buff, which made the rooms seem lighter. I thanked
her as heartily as I could, and watched her depart
up the road, pausing only long enough to press to her
nose the first bud on the great lilac tree at the
corner.</p>

<p>The place seemed curiously deserted after she had
gone. I went out into the vegetable area to see if Mike
and Joe were getting on all right, and to watch them
planting, that I might learn how it was done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we pretty late with all these seeds?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>Mike shook his head. &#8220;There&#8217;s some things, like
peas, ye can&#8217;t get in too soon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and some like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
termaters and cauliflowers that ye got to start under
glass; but up here in these mountains, with the frosts
comin&#8217; and the cold nights, ye don&#8217;t know when, ye can
wait till the middle o&#8217; May and dump on the manure
and get yer crop with the next man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m trusting you,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But next year
we&#8217;ll start earlier, just the same. I don&#8217;t want to be
with the next man. I want to beat him. I don&#8217;t see
why that isn&#8217;t what a farmer should do as well as a
merchant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, it is,&#8221; said Mike, &#8220;only the God almighty don&#8217;t
like it, and sinds frosts down upon yer presoomin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk like a Calvinist,&#8221; I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I dunno what that is,&#8221; Mike replied. &#8220;How
much of this last plantin&#8217; of corn shall I put in? It&#8217;s
Stowell&#8217;s Evergreen. Maybe it&#8217;s the frosts will get
it all, come September.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take a chance,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I&#8217;m a gambler.
Put in all you&#8217;ve got room for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sor,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and it&#8217;s pea brush we&#8217;ll be
needin&#8217; soon for them early peas I planted late. Is it
Joe I shall sind to cut some in the pasture lot behind
the barn?&#8221;</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t thought of my ten-acre pasture across the
road. In fact, I had scarcely been in it. &#8220;What&#8217;s
there to cut?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poverty birch,&#8221; said Mike. &#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s walkin&#8217; up
from the brook like it was a weed, which it are, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
eatin&#8217; the good grass up. The pasture will be better
for it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut away, then,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But, mind you, no
other trees!&#8221;</p>

<p>I went back to my sundial, between two rows of cauliflower
plants Bert had given to me, and which Mike had
set out thus early for an experiment, between threads of
sprouting radishes, lines of onion sets, and other succulent
evidences of the season to come. As I started to
mark out the beds around the pedestal, I found myself
wishing Miss Goodwin were there to advise me. I
made a few marks on the ground, surveyed the pattern,
didn&#8217;t like it, could think of nothing better, and resolved
to await her return. I took a few steps toward
the house. Then I stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you fool,&#8221; I said to myself. &#8220;This is your
house. You are going to live in it. If you can&#8217;t plan
it yourself, you&#8217;d better go back to teaching.&#8221;</p>

<p>I returned to the dial and went to work again. She
had suggested a ring of low flowers, and some taller
ones, irregularly set. I measured off a six-foot circle
about the pedestal, as the inner ring of the beds, and
left four breaks in it, to the four cardinal points of the
compass, where the turf or paths could come in to the
dial. Then I extended the sides of these four beds on
the straight axes of the paths for three feet, and made
the rear sides not on the regular arc of the inner edges,
but full of irregularities, almost of bulges, where I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
would set clumps of tall flowers. &#8220;She&#8217;ll like that, I
guess,&#8221; I reflected, and then caught myself at it, and
grinned rather sheepishly.</p>

<p>I rose and went to the barn for a load of manure.
The great pile which had been there when I bought
the place was already used up, but I secured enough
litter with a rake to cover the beds and brought it
back. By then the hour was nearly twelve, and consequently
too late to spade it under, so I went into the
house to see if the painters were getting the colour
right. They were, or as nearly right as it seems to be
humanly possible for house painters to do, and I plodded
up the road to dinner. As I passed my potato field, I
saw rows of green shoots above the ground, and out
under my lone pine I saw a figure, sitting in the shadow
on the stone wall.</p>

<p>I climbed through the brambles over the wall, and
walked down the aisles of potatoes toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is time for dinner,&#8221; I said meekly.</p>

<p>She looked up. &#8220;Is it? I have been listening to
the old pine talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was he saying?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Things you wouldn&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;About words in &#8217;hy&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;Not at all; nothing quite
so stupid&#8211;but nearly as saddening.&#8221; She rose to her
feet, and her eyes looked into mine, enigmatically wistful.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>&#8220;I missed you after you went away from Twin
Fires,&#8221; said I suddenly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I
got the sundial beds right or not. Won&#8217;t you please
come back to tell me? Or am I stupid again, and
mustn&#8217;t you advise me about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes twinkled a little. &#8220;You are still very
stupid,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but perhaps I will consent to give
my invaluable advice on this important subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll build some more
trellis if your hands are better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My hands are all right,&#8221; she said, with the faintest
emphasis on the noun, which made a variety of perplexing
interpretations possible and kept me silent as
I helped her over the wall into Bert&#8217;s great cauliflower
field, and we tramped through the soft soil toward the
house.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span><a id='link_9'></a>Chapter IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>WE SEAT THOREAU IN THE CHIMNEY NOOK, AND I WRITE A SONNET</span></h2>

<p>After dinner she approved the sundial beds with
a mock-judicial gravity, and then she went at the trellis,
working with a kind of impersonal nervous intensity
that troubled me, I didn&#8217;t quite know why. She said,
with a brief laugh, it was because she had suggested
the structure, and she could never rest till any job she
had undertaken was completed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You live too hard,&#8221; said I. &#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble
with most of us nowadays. We are over-civilized.
We don&#8217;t know how to take things easy, because we
have the vague idea of so many other things to be done
always crowding across the threshold of our consciousness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;The &#8217;J&#8217; words, for instance,
if they get &#8217;I&#8217; done before my return. Thank
heaven, &#8217;J&#8217; hasn&#8217;t contributed so many words to science
as &#8217;Hy&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget the dictionary!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;You are going
to stay here a long time&#8211;till these roses bloom, or at
any rate till the sundial beds have come to flower.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
Besides, there&#8217;ll be a lot of things about my house where
your advice cannot be spared.&#8221;</p>

<p>She darted a quick look at me, and turned back to
the trellis, where she was nailing on strips. She did
not speak, and when I came over to face her, with a
post for the next arch, I saw that her eyes were moist.
She turned her face half away, blinking her eyelids
hard, bit her lip, then picked up the level and set it
with a smack against the post. I put my hand over
hers&#8211;both our hands were dirty!&#8211;and said, &#8220;What is
the matter? Are you tired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, please&#8211;level this post,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you tired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not tired. I&#8217;m a fool. Come, we must
finish the arch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we won&#8217;t do any more arches to-day,&#8221; I
replied, &#8220;or you won&#8217;t, at any rate. You&#8217;ll go home
and rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me an instant with just the hint of her
twinkle coming back. &#8220;I&#8217;m so unused to taking orders,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;that I&#8217;ve lost the art of obedience. Move
the post a little to the right, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did so, and we worked on in silence. We had built
the wide central arch by the time the sun began to
drop down into our faces. There were only five arches
more to build.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall write to-night and have the roses hurried
along,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>We walked back toward the house and looked over
the lawn, past the sundial, and saw the farm through
the trellis, and beyond the farm the trees at the edge of
my clearing, and then a distant roof or two, and the
far hills. The apple blossoms were fragrant in the
orchard. The persistent song sparrows were singing.
The shadow of the dial post stretched far out toward
the east.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is pointing toward the brook,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Shall
we go and ask the thrush to sing?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;Not to-night,&#8221; she said briefly,
and I walked, grieved and puzzling, up the road by her
side.</p>

<p>The next day she pleaded a headache, and I went to
the farm alone. The south room was shining with its
first coat of paint. Hard was, as he put it &#8220;seein&#8217;
daylight&#8221; in his work, and I realized that soon I should
be sending for Mrs. Pillig and son Peter and moving
away from Bert&#8217;s. Somehow the idea made me perversely
melancholy. The house seemed lonely as I wandered
through it, sniffing the strong odour of fresh paint.</p>

<p>I went out to find Mike, and learned that the small
fruits had come&#8211;a hundred red raspberries, fifty blackcaps,
twenty-five of the yellow variety, a hundred
blackberries, not to mention currant bushes. We
walked about the garden to find the best site for them,
and finally chose for the berries the end of the slope
between the vegetables and field crops and the pines
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
and tamaracks. Here was a long, narrow stretch
where the brook in times past had made the soil sandy,
so that it drained well, but where the swampy land was
close enough to offer the least danger of complete drying
out. While Mike and Joe were ploughing the dressing
under and harrowing, I took my garden manual in
hand and carefully sorted out the varieties according
to their bearing season. Then we began planting them
in rows.</p>

<p>There is no berry so fascinating nor so delicious to me
as a raspberry, especially at breakfast, half hidden under
golden cream. There is something soft and cool and
wild about it; it is the feline of berries. As we planted,
I could almost smell the fruit. I could fancy the joy
of walking between these dewy rows in the fresh morning
sun and picking my breakfast. I could imagine
the crates of ripe fruit sent to market.</p>

<p>In the pleasures of my fancy and the monotony of
measured planting, I lost track of time, nor did I think
of Miss Goodwin. But thought of her returned at
noon, however, when Mrs. Bert told me her head had
felt better and she had gone off for a day&#8217;s trolley trip
to see the country. After all, it was rather selfish of
me not to show her the country! Besides, I hadn&#8217;t
seen it myself. I had been too busy. Why shouldn&#8217;t
I take a day off? But I couldn&#8217;t do that till the berries
were all in, and that afternoon was not enough to
finish them. It took all of the next day as well, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
most of the day following, for we had the double rows
of wire to mount as supports for the vines, and the
currant bushes to set in as a border to the garden six
feet south of the rose trellis. Most of this work I did
alone, leaving Mike free for other tasks, and Joe free
to cut the pea brush. I saw Miss Goodwin only at
meals. After supper I had to drive myself to my
manuscripts.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be you who will need a rest soon,&#8221; she said
the second morning, as she came down to breakfast and
found me hard at work out on the front porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take one&#8211;with you!&#8221; said I. &#8220;I want
to see the country, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled a little, and picked a lilac bud, holding it
to her nose. She seemed quite far away now. The
first few days of our rapid intimacy had passed, and
now she was as much a stranger to me as on that first
meeting in the pines. I said nothing about her coming
to the farm; I don&#8217;t know why. Somehow, I was
piqued. I wished her to make the first move. In
some way, it was all due to my asking her to choose the
paint for my dining-room, and that seemed to me
ridiculous. I fear my manner showed my pique a
trifle, for I did not see her anywhere about when I left
after breakfast.</p>

<p>That evening I found the second coat of paint practically
dry in the south room, and there was no reason
why I shouldn&#8217;t install my desk at last, order some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
kerosene for my student lamp, and do my work there,
in my own new home, by my twin fires. The wind was
east as I walked back to supper, and there was no sun
to wake me in the morning, so that I slept till half-past
six. Outside the rain was pouring steadily down, and
I found Bert rejoicing, for it was badly needed. After
breakfast I waylaid Miss Goodwin.</p>

<p>&#8220;No work on the trellis to-day,&#8221; said I, swallowing
my pique; &#8220;so I&#8217;m going to fix up the south room. I&#8217;m
going to make twin fires out of some of the nice, fragrant
apple wood you haven&#8217;t sawed for me, and hang
the Hiroshiges, and unpack the books, and have an
elegant time&#8211;if you don&#8217;t make me do it alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl shot a look around Mrs. Bert&#8217;s sitting-room,
where a small stuffed owl stood on the mantel under a
glass case and a transparent pink muslin sack filled
with burst milkweed pods was draped over a crayon
portrait of Bert as a young man. I followed her glance
and then our eyes met.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same, they are dear, good souls,&#8221; she
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;But to sit here on a cold,
rainy day! You may read by the fire while I work.
Only please come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I read &#8217;The Foundations of the Nineteenth
Century,&#8217; Doctor Upton?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may read the dictionary, if you wish,&#8221; I
replied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>She went to get her raincoat. It was cold out of
doors, and the rain drove in our faces as we splashed
down the road. The painters had made a fire in the
kitchen range, and as we stepped in the warmth greeted
us in a curious, friendly way. I brought several logs
of dead apple wood into the big room, made a second
trip for kindlings, brought my one pair of andirons
from the shed and improvised a pair with bricks for
the other fireplace, and soon had the twin hearths cheerful
with dancing flames. Then I went back to the
shed, and brought the two cushions which had been on
my window-seats at college, to place them on the settle.
But as I came into the room, instead of finding
the girl waiting to sit by the fire, I saw her with sleeves
rolled up washing the west window. Her body was
outlined against the light, her hair making an aura
about her head. As she turned a little, I caught the
saucy grace of her profile. She was so intent upon her
task that she had not heard me enter, and I paused a
full moment watching her. Then I dropped the cushions
and cried, &#8220;Come, here&#8217;s your seat! That is no
task for a Ph. D.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want a seat,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m having a
grand time, and don&#8217;t care to have my erudition thrown
in my face. I love to wash windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But &#8217;The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century?&#8217;&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole nineteenth century is on these windows,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
she replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to scrub here to get at its
foundations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll get tired again,&#8221; I laughed, though with
real solicitude. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want you to come to work&#8211;only
to be company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to be company. Please get me
some fresh hot water.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the pail and fetched obediently. Then, while
she worked at the windows, I began tugging things in
from the shed, calling Joe from the barn to help me with
the desk and bookcases. The desk, obviously, went by
the west window, where the light would come from the
left. My five bookcases, which had been made for
my college rooms, of uniform size, were placed, four
along the south wall, filling the spaces between the
central door and the two windows, and the two windows
and the end walls, with the fifth on the west wall
between the window and the south, where I could have
my reference books close to my desk chair. My piano,
which had stood in the dining-room ever since the furniture
had arrived, we unboxed, wheeled in to fill the space
between the small east windows, and took the covers off.</p>

<p>I looked around. Already the place was assuming a
homelike air, and the long room had contracted into
intimacy. The girl dropped her rag into the pail, and
stood looking about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the nice room!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;And oh, the dirty
piano!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>I went out to begin on the books, and when I returned
with the first load (I used a wheelbarrow, and
wheeled a big load covered with my raincoat as far as
the front door, and up into the hall on a plank), Miss
Goodwin was scrubbing the keys. As I began to wipe
off the books and set them into the cases, I could hear
that peculiar dust-cloth glissando which denotes domestic
operations on the piano, and which brings curiously
home to a man memories of his mother. When I
returned with the next load, I brought the piano bench,
as well. The girl was busy with the east window,
and I set the bench down in silence. She was seated
upon it, when I arrived with the third load, and
through the house were dancing the sounds of a Bach
gavotte.</p>

<p>She stopped playing as I entered, and looked up with
a little smile of apology.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please go on!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you play,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I just drum. It&#8217;s
too silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I play with one finger only,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the forefinger
of the right hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why do you have the piano?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For you,&#8221; I smiled. &#8220;Please play on. You can&#8217;t
guess how pleasant it is, how&#8211;how&#8211;homelike.&#8221;</p>

<p>She wheeled back and let her hands fall on the keys,
rippling by a natural suggestion into the old tune
&#8220;Amaryllis.&#8221; The logs were crackling. The gay old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
measures flooded the room with sound. My head nodded
in time, as I stacked the books on the shelves.</p>

<p>Suddenly the music stopped, and with a rustle of
skirts the girl was beside me. &#8220;There! Now I must
help you with the books!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What&#8217;s this?
Oh, you&#8217;re not putting them up right at all! Here&#8217;s
James&#8217;s &#8217;Pragmatism&#8217; hobnobbing with &#8217;The Freedom
of the Will.&#8217; Oh, horrors, and &#8217;Cranford&#8217; next to Guy
de Maupassant! I&#8217;m sure that isn&#8217;t proper!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; said I, &#8220;it ought to prove a fine
thing for both of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She began to inspect titles, pulling out books here,
substituting others there, carrying some to other cases.
&#8220;You won&#8217;t know where anything is, anyhow, in these
new surroundings,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so you might as well
start right&#8211;separate cases for fiction, history, philosophy,
and so on. Please have the poetry over the
settle by the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; said I. &#8220;That goes without saying. Here,
I&#8217;ll lug the books in, and you put &#8217;em up. Only I insist
on the reference books going over by my desk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, you may have them,&#8221; she laughed.</p>

<p>I wheeled in load after load. &#8220;Lord,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;of
the making of many books, <i>et cetera!</i> I&#8217;ll never buy
another one, or else I&#8217;ll never move again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never move again, you mean,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;Look, all the nice poetry by the west fireplace. Don&#8217;t
the green Globe editions look pretty in the white cases?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
And Keats right by the chimney. Please, may I put
the garden books, and old Mr. Thoreau, by the east
fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give old Mr. Thoreau any seat he wants,&#8221; said I,
&#8220;only Mr. Emerson must sit beside him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Mr. Emerson? Oh, yes, here he is, in a
blue suit. Here, we&#8217;ll plant the rose of beauty on the
brow of chaos!&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the set of Emerson and placed it in the top
shelf by the east fireplace, above a tumbled heap of unassorted
volumes, standing back to survey it with her
gurgling laugh. &#8220;What is so decorative as books?&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;They beat pictures or wall paper. Oh,
the nice room, the nice books, nice old Mr. Emerson,
nice twin fires!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And nice librarian,&#8221; I added.</p>

<p>She darted a look at me, laughed with heightened
colour, and herself added, with a glance at her wrist
watch, &#8220;And nice dinner!&#8221;</p>

<p>I brought back some of my manuscripts after dinner,
in case the room should be completed before supper
time. We attacked it again with enthusiasm, hers being
no less, apparently, than mine, for it was indeed
wonderful to see the place emerge from bareness into
the most alluring charm as the books filled the shelves,
as my two Morris chairs were placed before the fires,
as my three or four treasured rugs were unrolled on the
rather uneven but charmingly old floor which just fitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
the old, rugged hearthstones, and finally as the two
bright Hiroshiges were placed in the centre of the two
white wood panels over the fireplaces, and the other pictures
hung over the bookcases.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; cried the girl suddenly. &#8220;Have you any
vases?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A couple of glass ones,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get them, and never mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>I found the barrel which contained breakables in
the shed, unpacked it, and brought in the contents&#8211;a
few vases, my college tea set, a little Tanagra dancing-girl.
I placed the dancing figure on top of the shelf
between the settles, and Miss Goodwin set the tea
things on my one table by the south door. Then she
got an umbrella and vanished. A few minutes later
she returned with two clumps of sweet flag blades from
the brookside, placed one in each of the small vases,
and stood them on the twin mantels, beneath the
Japanese prints.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she cried, clapping her hands. &#8220;Now what
do you think of your room?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at the young green spears, at the bookcases
with their patterns of colour, at the warm rugs on the
floor, at my desk ready for me by the window, at the
student lamp upon it, at the crimson cushions on the
twin settles, at the leaping flames on the hearths, and
then at the bright, flushed, eager face of the girl, raindrops
glistening in her hair.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i2'></a><img src='images/illus-124.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
She was sitting with a closed book on her knee, gazing into the fire
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>&#8220;I think it is wonderful,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I have my home
at last! And how you have helped me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you have your home,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Oh, it is
such a nice one!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away, and went over to the east fire,
poking it with her toe. I lit my pipe, sat down at my
old, familiar desk, heaved a great sigh of comfort, and
opened a manuscript.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only four o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I can get in that
hour I wasted in sleep this morning. Can you find
something to read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to,&#8221; she smiled.</p>

<p>I plunged into the manuscript&#8211;a silly novel. I
heard Miss Goodwin on the other side of the settle,
taking down a book. I read on. The room was very
still. Presently the stillness roused me from my work,
and I looked up. I could not see the girl, so I rose from
my chair and tiptoed around the settle. She was sitting
with a closed book on her knee, gazing into the
fire. I sat down, too, and touched her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there?&#8221; I asked, pointing to the flames.</p>

<p>She looked around, with a half-wistful little smile.
&#8220;You are not making up that lost hour,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the room was so still,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that I wondered
where you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I was many miles away,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Do
you want me to make a noise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might sing for me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>&#8220;I should hate to make the thrush jealous. No,
my accomplishments cease with philology. I&#8217;m very
happy here, really. You must go back to your work.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went back, and read a few more pages of the silly
novel.</p>

<p>&#8220;This story is so silly I really think it would be a
success,&#8221; I called out.</p>

<p>A head peeped up at me over the settle. &#8220;You
aren&#8217;t working,&#8221; she reproached. &#8220;I&#8217;m going away, so
you won&#8217;t have me to talk to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; I cried, slamming the
manuscript into a drawer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come down here and
work after supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;ll work till five o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unless you&#8217;ll stay!&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes looked at me over the settle, and I looked
steadily back. We each smiled a little, silently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said she, as the head disappeared.</p>

<p>I read on, vaguely aware that the west was breaking,
and the room growing warm. Presently I heard
a window opened and felt the cooler rush of rain-freshened
air from the fragrant orchard. Then I heard
the painters come downstairs, talking, and tramp out
through the kitchen. It was five o&#8217;clock. But I still
read on, to finish a chapter. The painters had departed.
The entire house was still.</p>

<p>Suddenly there stole through the room the soft andante
theme of a Mozart sonata, and the low sun at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
almost the same instant dropped into the clear blue
hole in the west and flooded the room. I let the manuscript
fall, and sat listening peacefully for a full minute.
Then I moved across the floor and stood behind
the player. How cheerful the room looked, how booky
and old-fashioned! It seemed as if I had always dwelt
there. It seemed as if this figure at the piano had always
dwelt there. How easy it would be to put out my hands
and rest them on her shoulders, and lay my cheek
to her hair! The impulse was ridiculously strong to do
so, and I tingled to my finger tips with a strange excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; I said, &#8220;it is after five, and the sun is out.
We will go to hear the thrush.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl faced around on the bench, raising her face
to mine, &#8220;Yes, let us,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;How lovely
the room looks now. Oh, the nice new old room!&#8221;</p>

<p>She lingered in the doorway a second, and then we
stepped out of the front entrance, where we stood entranced
by the freshness of the rain-washed world in
the low light of afternoon, and the heavy fragrance of
wet lilac buds enveloped us. Then the girl gathered
her skirts up and we went down through the orchard,
where the ground was strewn with the fallen petals,
through the maples where the song sparrow was singing,
and in among the dripping pines. The brook was whispering
secret things, and the drip from the trees made
a soft tinkle, just detectable, on its pools.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>We waited one minute, two minutes, three minutes
in silence, and then the fairy clarion sounded, the &#8220;cool
bars of melody from the everlasting evening.&#8221; It
sounded with a thrilling nearness, so lovely that it almost
hurt, and instinctively I put out my hand and
felt for hers. She yielded it, and so we stood, hand in
hand, while the thrush sang once, twice, three times,
now near, now farther away, and then it seemed from
the very edge of my clearing. I still held her hand, as
we waited for another burst of melody. But he evidently
did not intend to sing again. My fingers closed
tighter over hers as I felt her face turn toward mine, and
she answered their pressure while her eyes glistened, I
thought, with tears. Then her hand slipped away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak,&#8221; she said, leading the way out of the
grove.</p>

<p>We went into the house again to make sure that the
fires had burned down. The room was darker now,
filled with twilight shadows. The last of the logs were
glowing red on the hearths, and the air was hot and
heavy after the fresh outdoors. But how cheerful, how
friendly, how like a human thing, with human feelings
of warmth and welcome, the room seemed to me!</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been a wonderful day,&#8221; said I, as we turned
from the fires to pass out. &#8220;I wonder if I shall ever
have so much joy again in my house?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl at my side did not answer. I looked at her,
and saw that she was struggling with tears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>I did instinctively the only thing my clumsy ignorance
could suggest&#8211;put my hand upon hers. She
withdrew it quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she cried under her breath. &#8220;Oh, I am
such a fool! Fool&#8211;Middle English <i>fool</i>, <i>fole</i>, <i>fol</i>; Icelandic,
<i>fol</i>; old French <i>fol</i>&#8211;always the same word!&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke into a plaintive little laugh, ran through
the hall and lifted the stove lid to see if the fire there was
out, and hastened to the road, where I had difficulty
to keep pace with her as we walked up the slope to
supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need a rest more than you think, I guess,&#8221; I
tried to say, but she only answered, &#8220;I need it less!&#8221;
and made off at once to her room. That night I didn&#8217;t
go back to my house to work. I didn&#8217;t work at all.
I looked out of my window at a young moon for a long
while, and then&#8211;yes, I confess it, though I was thirty
years old, I wrote a sonnet!</p>

<p>The next morning I did not urge Miss Goodwin to
come to the farm. In fact, I urged her to sit in the sun
and rest. It was a glorious day, a real June day,
though June was not due till the following Wednesday.
It was Sunday, the Sunday preceding Memorial Day.
But, as my farm was so far from the centre of the village,
and my lawn was so screened from the roads by
the house on one side and the pines and maples on the
other, I resolved to hazard my reputation and go at my
lawn, which the rain at last had settled. I hitched the
horse to my improvised drag and smoothed it again,
several times, in default of a roller. Then I led the
horse back to the barn.</p>

<p>As I came to the barn door again, a carryall was passing,
with a woman and a stout girl on the back seat,
and another stout girl and a man on the front seat.
The women were dressed in their starched best, the
man, an elderly farmer with a white beard, in the blue
uniform and slouch hat of the G. A. R. They were
going to Memorial service. I instinctively saluted as
the old fellow nodded to me in his friendly, country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
way, and he dropped the reins with a pleased smile and
brought his own hand snap up to his hat brim. I
watched the carryall disappear, hearing it rattle over
the bridge across my brook, and for the first time felt
myself a stranger in this community. I suddenly
wanted to go with them to church, to hear the drone of
the organ and the soft wind rushing by the open windows,
bringing in the scent of lilacs, to see the faces of
my neighbours about me, to chat with them on the
church steps when the service was over. I realized
how absorbed I had been in my own little farm, and
resolved to begin getting acquainted with the town as
soon as possible. Then I picked up a rake, and went
back to the lawn.</p>

<p>As soon as I had eliminated the horse&#8217;s hoofprints, I
got a bag of lawn seed and scattered it, probably using
a good deal more than was necessary. Mike had assured
me it was too late to sow grass, but I hoped for
fool&#8217;s luck. I sowed it carefully about the sundial
beds, so that none should fall on them, but over the rest
of the lawn I let it fall from on high, delighting in the
way it drifted with the gentle wind on its drop to earth.
I had not sown long before the birds began to come,
by ones, then by twos and threes and fours, till it
seemed as if fifty of them were hopping about. I shooed
them away, but back they came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; thought I, &#8220;lawn seed is not so terribly expensive,
and they can&#8217;t pick it all up!&#8221; I scattered it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
thicker than ever, and then harrowed it under a little
with a rake, working till one o&#8217;clock, for Sunday dinner
was at one-thirty. Then I went back to Bert&#8217;s, with
only a peep into my big south room to see how cheerful
it looked. I found Miss Goodwin still sitting where I
had left her, under the sycamore before the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve obeyed,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not read,
nor even thought. I&#8217;ve &#8217;jest set.&#8217; But I&#8217;m beginning
to get restless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Shall we celebrate the Sabbath
by taking a walk? I&#8217;d like to have you show me Bentford.&#8221;</p>

<p>She assented, and right after dinner we set out, I
having donned my knickerbockers and a collar for the
first time since my arrival, and feeling no little discomfort
from the starched band around my throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;The size of it is,&#8221; I groaned, &#8220;all my clothes are
now too small for me. If you stay here till July, you&#8217;ll
probably have to send for an entire new wardrobe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the fear which haunts me,&#8221; she smiled, as
we crossed my brook and turned up the hill toward
the first of the big estates. In front of this estate we
paused and peeped through the hedge. The family had
evidently arrived, for the unmistakable sounds of a
pianola were issuing from the house. The great formal
garden, still gay with Darwin tulips and beginning to
show banks of iris flowers against lilac shrubbery, looked
extremely expensive. The residence itself, of brown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
stucco, closely resembled a sublimated $100,000 ice-house.
An expensive motor stood before the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;How rich and ugly it is,&#8221; said Miss Goodwin, turning
away. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not look at houses. Let&#8217;s find some
woods to walk in.&#8221;</p>

<p>We looked about us toward the high hills which ring
the Bentford valley, and struck off toward what seemed
the nearest. The side road we were on soon brought
us to the main highway up the valley to the next town,
and a motor whizzed past us, leaving a cloud of dust,
then a second, and a third. We got off the highway as
speedily as possible, crossing a farm pasture and entering
the timber on the first slope of the big hill. Here a
wood road led up, and we loitered along it, finding late
violets and great clumps of red trilliums here and there.</p>

<p>The girl sprang upon the first violets with a little
cry of joy, picking them eagerly and pressing them to
her nose. &#8220;Smell!&#8221; she laughed, holding them up to
mine. She soon had her hands full, and was forced to
pass by the next bed&#8211;as I told her, with the regret of
a child who has eaten all the cake he can at a church
supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;No child ever ate all the cake he could,&#8221; she laughed.
&#8220;Oh, please dig up some trilliums and plant them in
your garden, or rather in your woods!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are we going to get them home?&#8221; said I.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to dig up some of the earth, too, with the
roots.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Even if I am a highbrow,
I&#8217;ve not quite forgotten my childhood lessons in manual
work&#8211;which I always hated till now. I&#8217;ll weave
a basket.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking about, I saw a wild grape vine, and I pulled
it down from the tree to which it was clinging. &#8220;I feel
like a suffragette,&#8221; said I, &#8220;destroying the clinging vine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut it into two-foot lengths,&#8221; she retorted, &#8220;and
don&#8217;t make poor puns.&#8221; She sat on the brown needles
at the foot of a pine, and began twisting the pieces of
vine into a rough basket. I sat beside her and watched
her work. Out beyond us was a sun-soaked clearing, a
tiny swamp on the hillside, and the sunlight dappled
in across her skirt. As she worked, a wood thrush
called far off, his last long-drawn note ringing like a
sweet, wistful fairy horn. The white fingers paused in
their weaving, and our eyes met. She did not speak,
but looked smiling into my face as the call was repeated,
while her throat fluttered. Then, without speaking, she
turned back to her work. I, too, was silent. What
need was there of words?</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that a hermit, too?&#8221; she asked presently.
&#8220;It sounded different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, a wood thrush,&#8221; said I. &#8220;He&#8217;s not so Mozartian.&#8221;</p>

<p>She finished the basket and held it out proudly.
&#8220;There!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t pretty, and it isn&#8217;t art,
but it will hold trilliums.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>She dusted off her skirt, and I helped her to her feet.
We continued up the road, looking for trilliums, and
when the first large clump appeared pushing up their
dark red blooms from the leafy mould, we were both
on our knees beside it, prying it up, earth and all. We
soon had the basket filled, and then pressed on straight
up the hillside, leaving the wood road. It was a steep
scramble, over rocks where the thin, mossy soil slipped
from under foot, and through tangles of mountain laurel
bushes. I had frequently to help her, for she was not
used to climbing, and she was breathing hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s stop,&#8221; said I. &#8220;This is too hard work for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She grasped a dead stick, like a banner staff, struck
an attitude, and cried, &#8220;Excelsior!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; she added, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to reach the top of
this hill and look down the other side if I die on the
summit. I know now for the first time why Annie
Peck and Hudson Stuck risked their lives on Mount
Something-or-other in the Andes and Mount McKinley
in Alaska. It&#8217;s a grand sensation. I feel the primal
urge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ever climb a mountain?&#8221; I queried,
incredulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Never even a baby
mountain like this. My altitude record is the top step
of the Columbia University library.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor child!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;ll <i>carry</i> you to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
the top! I never realized that you were such a hopeless
urbanite.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went on more slowly, for the way was very steep
now, and between helping her and holding the trilliums
level I had my hands full. Laughing when we had the
breath, we scrambled through the last of the shrubbery,
and suddenly stood on a flat rock at the summit, with
the world spread out below us like a map. I set down
the basket, wiped my face, and ruefully felt of my wilted
collar. The girl sank, panting, on the rock, fanned herself
with her wisp of a handkerchief, and gazed out
over the green Bentford valley below to the far hills
in the south. The sky above us was very blue and
lazy afternoon clouds were floating in it. Far up here
only a few birds peeped in the scrub. We seemed
strangely alone in that privacy of the peak.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Silent upon a peak in Darien!&#8217;&#8221; I heard her say,
as if to herself. Then she turned her eager face to
mine. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it wonderful!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Look, all
the world like a map below you, and all this sky to see
at once, and the cooling breeze and the feeling that you
are above everybody! Oh, I love it! Quick, now let
me see the other side!&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran across the rock, and I after her. From this
side we looked between the trees into the valley to the
north, the next valley to Bentford, and saw a blue lake,
like a piece of the sky dropped down, and several large
estates, and the green and brown checkerboards of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
farms, and far off a white steeple above the trees, and
then once more on the horizon the eternal ring of blue
mountains. Even as we gazed, from somewhere below
us drifted up, faint and sweet, the sound of a church
bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is nice on the roof of the world!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Think of that&#8211;here am I, a Ph. D. in philology, and
the only adjective I can find is &#8217;nice&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all in how you say it,&#8221; I smiled. &#8220;I think I
understand. I called you &#8217;poor child&#8217; a few moments
ago because you&#8217;d never been on a high hilltop. Now
I take it back. Think of getting those first virgin
impressions when you are old enough to appreciate
them! I envy you. I was only five when they took me
up Mount Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think you&#8217;d have insisted on the Matterhorn
by the time you were ten,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;I
should.&#8221;</p>

<p>We hunted out some soft moss in the shade, and sat
down to get cool in the summit breeze before the descent.
The girl spoke little, her eyes wandering constantly
off over the view with the light of discovery in
them. In my own staid way, I had always fancied I
enjoyed the quieter pleasures of the outdoors as much as
any one, but before this rapture I was almost abashed.
If I did not speak, it was chiefly because I feared to
drop clumsy words into her mood.</p>

<p>But presently I did suggest that we must be starting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
down. As there was no path visible&#8211;later I have
found that since the advent of motors there are never
any paths where the walking is in the least strenuous!&#8211;we
took the way we had come, and began the descent.
Naturally I went ahead, and helped her all I could.
To one unaccustomed to hard walking, a steep descent
is more tiresome than a climb, and I began to fear that
I had led her into an excess. But she came bravely
tumbling along behind. In some places I had to put
up my arms and lift her down. In others she had to
slide one foot far ahead for a secure resting-place, with
a reckless show of stocking. But she laughed it all off
gayly. We missed, somehow, the way we had taken up,
and presently found ourselves on a ledge with a clean
drop of eight feet. I prospected to right and left, found
a place where the drop was only six, and jumped.
Then she lowered the basket to me, sat on the edge
herself, leaned out and put her arms about my neck,
and I swung her off. As I set her on the ground again
our faces were close together for an instant, and I could
feel rather than see her eyes laughing into mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a very pleasant hill,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we are almost to the wood road now,&#8221; she
darted back, jumping into the lead.</p>

<p>A moment more, and we stood in the wood road, and
presently we came upon a spring under a rock, and
plunged our faces into it and drank. She looked up
with the water dripping from her saucy nose, and quoted:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
&#8220;&#8217;As rivers of water in a dry place.&#8217; I&#8217;m learning lots
to-day. Now it&#8217;s the elemental force of the Bible
similes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the wisdom isn&#8217;t in New York&#8211;and dictionaries,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now you&#8217;ve mentioned the Dictionary! How
could you!&#8221; she cried, and suddenly, like a child, snapped
water into my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve ruined my collar,&#8221; said I solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your collar looks like a fat man&#8217;s at a dance in
July,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Let&#8217;s give the poor trilliums a drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put the basket by the spring, dipped her hands
in the water, and then let palmsful drop on the wilted
flowers. &#8220;How woodsy they smell!&#8221; she cried, leaning
over them. &#8220;Now I&#8217;m going to wash my face again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was like a child. She buried her face in the water,
and when she emerged the little curly hairs on her
temples were dripping. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to wade in it!&#8221; she
exclaimed. &#8220;I wonder if I dare!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go down the road and
wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t be daring,&#8221; she twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll sit here and wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me saucily, and laughed, shaking her
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coward,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>But she only laughed again, sprang up, and started
rapidly away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>I caught her by the arm. &#8220;Easy, easy,&#8221; I cautioned.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a broken-down, nervous wreck, remember.
You mustn&#8217;t overdo things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her moods were many that afternoon. Again she
looked at me, but didn&#8217;t laugh. Her eyes, instead,
held a sort of startled gratitude, like those of a person,
unused to kindness, suddenly befriended. She was no
longer the child let loose in the woods. She walked
slowly at my side, and so we came down to the high-road
again. At the road we looked back to the hilltop
where we had been.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much easier the climb looks than it is,&#8221; said
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way of hills&#8211;and other things,&#8221; said I
sententiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew about the other things,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;Now I&#8217;ve learned it about the hills. It seems as if I
were learning all the old similes wrong end foremost,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8211;springs and&#8211;and all?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tone was wistful, and it was with difficulty that
I refrained from touching her hand. &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s
something to be said for that method,&#8221; I answered
cheerfully. &#8220;Think of all the pleasant things you have
to learn. The other way around you get the grim
realism last.&#8221;</p>

<p>But a thought plagued her as we turned down the
side road to my house. However, her face cleared as
we drew near, and as the house itself appeared she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
clapped her hands, crying, &#8220;Now, where are we going
to put the trilliums?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the edge of the pines,&#8221; I suggested, &#8220;where they
can talk with the brook?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the place.&#8221; Suddenly she paused, looked
back up the slope, and cried, &#8220;Do you suppose this
brook is that spring?&#8221;</p>

<p>I hastily ran over the contour of the country we had
passed through, and saw that indeed the spring must
be its headwaters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She darted a look at me, with twinkling eyes. &#8220;I
shan&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>I got a trowel, and we planted the withered trilliums
in partial shade between the maples and the pines, and
gave them water. Then I showed her the newly sown
lawn, and we peeped in to see the Hiroshiges over the
twin fires.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, home and to bed for you,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;I know
you&#8217;ve done too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;ve had a wonderful time,&#8221; she answered
soberly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve&#8211;I&#8217;ve&#8211;it&#8217;s hard to explain&#8211;but I&#8217;ve
somehow connected up this house with the wild country
about it. Do you understand? If I had a house in the
country, I should want it where I could get out, this
way, on a Sunday afternoon into the woods and bring
home trilliums. It wouldn&#8217;t seem right, complete, if I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
couldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;d want my own dear garden, and then a
great big, God&#8217;s garden over the fence somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is how I feel, too,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Only I want,
also, to connect up my place with my neighbours; I
want myself to be a part of the human environment.
I thought of that this morning, as I saw the folks going
by to church. If I ever get Twin Fires done, I&#8217;m going
to join the Grange!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Twin Fires comes first, doesn&#8217;t it? I fear I&#8217;ve
been selfish to drag you off to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drag me off is good!&#8221; I laughed. &#8220;You poor little
city-bred, you, as if your enjoyment hadn&#8217;t given me
the happiest day of my life! Only I&#8217;m afraid you did
too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> pretty tired,&#8221; she admitted, with a happy
smile. &#8220;But I wouldn&#8217;t have missed it for the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was pretty tired myself, but I did a remarkably
good evening&#8217;s work, nevertheless, only pausing before
the start to wonder why it was she wept one night when
she wasn&#8217;t tired, and smiled the next when she had
tramped ten miles. But a man cannot afford to ponder
such problems in feminine psychology too closely if he
has anything else to do!</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span><a id='link_11'></a>Chapter XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>ACT√ÜON AND DIANA</span></h2>

<p>Memorial Day dawned fair and warm. Bert
and his wife and all their &#8220;help&#8221; went off to the village
after breakfast. There were no painters in my house,
and Mike had milked the cows and gone home before
I arrived. Miss Goodwin and I seemed to have that
little section of Bentford quite to ourselves, after the
last of the carryalls had rattled past, taking the veterans
from Slab City to the town. Having no flag
yet of my own, I borrowed one from Bert, and we hung
it from a second-story window, facing the road, as our
tiny contribution to the sentiment of the day. Then
we tackled the rose trellis, speedily completing it, for
only two arches remained to be built, one of the carpenters
having built three for me the day before, while
waiting for some shingles to come for the barn. Indeed,
we had it done by ten o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what?&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>I looked about the garden. The roses had not yet
come, so we couldn&#8217;t very well plant them. I judged
that the morning of a warm, sunny day was no time to
transplant seedlings. The painting was not yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
completed inside, so I could fix up no more of my rooms.
The vegetable garden didn&#8217;t appear to need cultivation.
We couldn&#8217;t paint the trellis, as there was no
green paint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;this is the first
time I&#8217;ve been at a loss for something to do. It&#8217;s a
terrible sensation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we build a bird bath?&#8221; she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said I, &#8220;you are a genius!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the brook?&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not the brook. I&#8217;ve a better idea. Up in
Stephen Parrish&#8217;s lovely garden in Cornish I once saw
a bird bath which we&#8217;ll try to duplicate, here on the
lawn, so the birds will have the water handy to wash
down the grass seed they are eating so fast. Let&#8217;s
see; we&#8217;ll need bricks, sand, cement, a mason&#8217;s trowel,
a spade, a hoe, a level, a box to mix in, and a box for a
frame.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had nearly a whole bag of cement left over from
my dab at orchard renovation, and there were plenty
of packing-boxes. I selected one which was exactly
square, about two feet on each side, and carefully
knocked the bottom out. A shallower one did for a
mixing-box. Down cellar, where my heater had been
installed, was a barrow load of extra bricks which the
plumber had left behind&#8211;inefficient business but very
convenient for me. Sand was easily procured by digging
a hole near the brook.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said I, &#8220;my plan is to put the bird bath on
the east edge of the lawn, halfway between the house
and the rose aqueduct, corresponding to the sundial in
the centre, and to a white bench which will be placed
at the west side when the grape arbour is built.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Approved,&#8221; laughed Miss Goodwin.</p>

<p>We measured off the spot, and I trundled the barrow
to a pile of coal ashes behind the barn&#8211;where the previous
owner had deposited them&#8211;and brought back
enough to make a frost-proof foundation. After we
had packed these into the ground and levelled them off, I
mixed a lot of cement, laid it over thick, set the bottomless
box frame down upon it, levelled that, and working
from the inside, of course, laid the bricks up against the
box, with a great deal of cement between them, and
built up the four sides. As the girl had no gloves, I
would not allow her to handle the cement (for nothing
cracks the skin so badly, as I had discovered in my
orchard work). But she kept busy mixing with the
hoe, and handing me bricks. Some I broke and put
in endwise, and I was careful to give all as irregular a
setting as possible, till the top was reached. Then, of
course, I laid an even line of the best bricks all the way
around, and levelled them carefully. We had scarcely
got the last brick on when we heard Bert&#8217;s carryall
rattle over the bridge and Bert&#8217;s voice yelling &#8220;Dinner!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! That cement in the box will harden!&#8221;
I cried. &#8220;Dump it all in.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>We tipped up the box, dumped the contents down
into the hollow centre of the brick work, and hurried
home to a cold dinner, for Mrs. Bert, too, had taken a
holiday that morning. But we were so impatient to be
back at our work that we didn&#8217;t care. On our return
we filled the rest of the hollow up with cement and
stones to within three inches of the top. Then, mixing
more cement, with only two parts of fine sand to one
of cement, I laid over an even surface of the mixture
and filled all the corners and cracks between the top
row of bricks, making a square bowl, as it were, two
inches deep, on the top of the little brick pile. We let
it settle a few moments, and then carefully broke away
the box. There stood the bird bath, needing only some
cleaning away of cement which had squeezed out between
bricks, and some filling in of hollows caused in
removing the frame. It really looked quite neat and
attractive, and not too formally bricky, as so much
cement showed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we put water in it yet?&#8221; the girl asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Cement will harden under water.
And we&#8217;ll plant climbing nasturtiums around it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>I spaded up the ground at the base a little, and we
went to the seed bed and dug up half a dozen climbing
nasturtiums, which were already six or seven inches
high. We set them in, got a pail of water from the brook
and watered them, and carefully filled the bath level
with the brim. Then we removed all the tools and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
boxes to the shed again, and came back to the south
door to survey our work.</p>

<p>We passed through the house. The kitchen, dining-room,
and hall were finished and the paint drying. They
looked very fresh and bright. The south room, as we
stepped into it, was flooded with sunlight and cheerful
with rugs and books. Flinging wide the glass door, we
stepped out upon the terrace of the pergola-to-be, and
looked toward the new bird bath. Upon its rim sat a
song sparrow! Even as we watched, another came
and fluttered his feet and breast daintily through the
trembling little mirror of water. Then came a robin
and drove them both away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pig!&#8221; laughed Miss Goodwin. &#8220;Do you know,
I&#8217;ve got a poorer opinion of robins since I came here.
We city dwellers think of robins as harbingers of spring,
and all that, and they epitomize the bird world. But
when you really are in that world, you find they are
rather large and vulgar and&#8211;and sort of upper West
Side-y. They aren&#8217;t half so nice as the song sparrows,
or the Peabodies, and, of course, compared with the
thrushes&#8211;well, it&#8217;s like comparing Owen Meredith with
Keats, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too hard on the robins,&#8221; I smiled.</p>

<p>We looked our fill at the new bird bath, which was
already functioning, as she said her boss on the dictionary
would put it, and at the white sundial pillar,
and at our prospective aqueduct of roses, and at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
farm and the far hills beyond&#8211;and then she suddenly
announced with great energy that she was going to saw
wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may saw just one piece,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and then you
are going to take a book and rest. I&#8217;m going to work,
myself. Twin Fires is getting in shape fast enough now
so I can give up part of the daytime to the purely mundane
task of paying the bills.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wheeled up a big dead apple branch from the orchard
to the wood shed, put it on the buck, gave her
the buck-saw, and watched her first efforts, grinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;You bother me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I went, opened the west window by my desk to
the wandering summer breeze, and went at my toil.
Presently I heard her tiptoeing into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;Now I want&#8211;let&#8217;s see what I want&#8211;well,
I guess &#8217;Marius the Epicurean&#8217; and &#8217;Alice in
Wonderland&#8217; will do. I&#8217;m going to sit in the orchard.
You work here till five or your salary will be docked.
Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard her go out by the front door, and then silence
settled over the sun-filled, cheerful room, while I plugged
away at my tasks. I don&#8217;t know how long I worked,
but finally my attention began to wander. I wondered
if she were still in the orchard. I looked out
upon the sweet stretches of my farm, with the golden
light of afternoon upon it, and work became a burden.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
&#8220;Shall I ever be able to work, except at night, or on
rainy days!&#8221; I wondered with a smile, as I tossed the
manuscript I was reading into a drawer, and went out
through the front entrance.</p>

<p>The girl was nowhere to be seen. &#8220;She&#8217;s probably
in her beloved pines,&#8221; I reflected. &#8220;It would be a
good time to clear out a path in the pines.&#8221; I turned
back to get a hatchet, and then went down toward the
brook.</p>

<p>I trod as noiselessly as I could through the maples,
thinking to surprise her at her reading, and took care
in the pines not to step on any dead twigs. She was
nowhere to be seen near the upper end of the grove, but
as I advanced I heard a splashing louder than the soft
ripple of the brook, and suddenly around a thick tree
at a bend in the stream, where the brook ran out toward
the tamarack swamp in the corner of my farm, I came
upon her. She had her shoes and stockings off, and
with her skirts held high she was wading with solemn,
quiet delight in a little pool. Her back was toward me.
I could have discreetly retreated, and she been none
the wiser. But, alas! Act√¶on was neither the first nor
the last of his sex. The water rippled so coolly around
her white ankles! The sunlight dappled down so charmingly
upon her chestnut hair! And I said, with a laugh,
&#8220;So that is why you wanted my brook to come from the
spring!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned with a little exclamation, the colour flaming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
to her cheeks. Then she, too, laughed, as she stood in
the brook, holding her skirts above the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Consider yourself turned to a stag,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;but don&#8217;t stay in that cold
water too long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do it will be your fault,&#8221; she smiled, with a sidelong
glance. Then she turned and began wading tentatively
downstream. But the brook deepened suddenly,
and she sank almost to her knees, catching her
skirts up just in time. I withdrew hastily, and called
back to her to come out. When I heard her on the
bank, I brought her a big handkerchief for a towel, and
withdrew once more, telling her to hurry and help me
plan the path through the pines. In a moment or two
she was by my side. We looked at each other. Her
face was still flushed, but her eyes were merry. We
were standing on almost the exact spot where we had
first met. But now there seemed in some subtle wise a
new bond of intimacy between us, a bond that had not
existed before this hour. I could not analyze it, but
I felt it, and I knew she felt it. But what she said
was:</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you to work till five o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s half-past four,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Besides, you
must have sent for me. Something suddenly prompted
me to come out and hunt you up, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To say I sent for you is rather&#8211;rather <i>forward</i>,
under the circumstances, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>&#8220;It might be&#8211;and it might not be,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;Did you have a good time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The best I ever had&#8211;till you spoiled it,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Oh, the nice, cold brook! Now, let&#8217;s build
the path you spoke about once.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went back to the maples, where the ground was
open, and selected a spot on the edge of the pines where
the path would most naturally enter. Then we let it
wind along by the brook, lopping off dead branches
which were in the way, and removing one or two small
trees. Once we took it across the brook, laying a line
of stepping-stones, and out almost to the stone wall,
where one could get a momentary glimpse of the road
and over the road the blue mountains. Then we bent
it in again, crossed the brook once more just above the
point where she had waded, and there I rolled a large
stone to the edge of the pool&#8211;&#8220;for you to sit on next
time,&#8221; I explained. Finally we skirted the tamarack
swamp, took the path up through the fringe of pines
at the southern end of the field crops, and let it come
back to the house beside the hayfield wall. When we
reached this wall, it was nearly six o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s just walk back through it!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;To-morrow we can bring the wheelbarrow, can&#8217;t we,
and pick up the litter we&#8217;ve made?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can, at any rate, while you wade,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She shot a little look up into my face. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll
help,&#8221; she smiled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>In the low afternoon light we turned about and retraced
our steps. There was but a fringe of pines along
the southern wall, and as they were forty-year-old trees
here the view both back to the house and over the wall
into the next pasture was airy and open. Then the path
led through a corner of the tamarack swamp where in wet
weather I should have to put down some planks, and
where the cattails grew breast high on either side. Then
it entered the thick pine grove where a great many
of the trees were evidently not more than fifteen or
twenty years old and grew very close. The sunlight
was shut out, save for daggers of blue between the trunks
toward the west. The air seemed hushed, as if twilight
were already brooding here. The little brook rippled
softly.</p>

<p>As we came to the first crossing, I pointed to the pool,
already dark with shadow, and said, &#8220;It was wrong of
me to play Act√¶on to your Diana, but I am not ashamed
nor sorry. You were very charming in the dappled
light, and you were doing a natural thing, and in among
these little pines, perhaps, two friends may be two friends,
though they are man and woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not reply at once, but stood beside me looking
at the dark pool and apparently listening to the whisper
of the running water against the stepping-stones. Finally
she said with a little laugh, &#8220;I have always thought
that perhaps Diana was unduly severe. Come, we must
be moving on.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>As the path swung out by the road, we heard a
carriage, and stopped, keeping very still, to watch it
drive past within twenty feet of us. The occupants
were quite unaware of our existence behind the thin
screen of roadside alders.</p>

<p>&#8220;How exciting!&#8221; she half whispered when the carriage
had gone by.</p>

<p>Once more we entered the pines, following the new
path over the brook again to the spot where we first had
met. There I touched her hand. &#8220;Let us wait for the
thrush here,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>I could see her glimmering face lifted to mine. &#8220;Why
here?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it was here we first heard him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, forgive me,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize!
The path has made it look different, I guess. Forgive
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke very low, and her voice was grieving. Did
it mean so much to her? A sudden pang went through
my heart&#8211;and then a sudden hot wave of joy&#8211;and
then sudden doubts. I was silent. So was the thrush.
Presently I touched her hand again, gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said I, &#8220;we have scared him with our chopping.
He will come back, though, and then we will
walk down the clean path, making no noise, and hear
him sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice path,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to come out of your
door, through your orchard, and wander up a path by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
a brook, through your own pines! Oh, fortunate
mortal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And find Diana wading in a pool,&#8221; I added.</p>

<p>Again she shot an odd, questioning look at me, and
shook her head. Then she ran into the south room and
put the books back on the shelves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one did you read, Marius or Alice?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; she smiled, as I locked the house behind
us.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span><a id='link_12'></a>Chapter XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>SHOPPING AS A DISSIPATION</span></h2>

<p>I thought I could move into my house on the
first of June&#8211;but I didn&#8217;t. A rainy day followed the
holiday, and in the rain we first set out the roses, which
had arrived by freight and which Bert brought over
from the village on an early trip, and then tackled the
rest of the interior of the house. I wouldn&#8217;t let Miss
Goodwin wash any windows, as that appeared to me to
be Mrs. Pillig&#8217;s job, but we hung my few remaining
pictures in the dining-room and hall, set up my old
mahogany drop-leaf table for a dining-table&#8211;it was
large enough for four people, on a pinch&#8211;and placed
the only two straight-backed chairs I possessed on either
side of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear!&#8221; said I. &#8220;I was going to have Mr. and
Mrs. Bert and you as my guests at my first meal, but it
looks as if you&#8217;d have to come alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could bring in a chair and the piano bench
from the south room,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;A more important
item seems to be dishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;I never thought of that! But
I&#8217;ve got silver, anyway. I&#8217;ve kept all my mother&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
silver. It&#8217;s in a tin box in the bottom drawer of my
desk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s something,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;Have you
got tablecloths and napkins and kitchen utensils&#8211;to
cook with, you know? And have you got some bedding
for Mrs. Pillig and son Peter?&#8221;</p>

<p>I ruefully shook my head. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a sleeping-bag,
though, which Peter could put on the floor. What am
I going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re going to make a trip to-morrow to the
nearest large town, and stock up,&#8221; she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I going alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed at me. &#8220;No, you helpless child, mamma
will go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the next morning we set off early, provided with a
list of necessary articles compiled with Mrs. Bert&#8217;s
assistance. We tramped over to Bentford and took the
train there for a city some seventeen miles away, which
we reached about half-past eight. It was a clean, neat
little city, with fine old trees on the residence streets,
and prosperous, well-stocked shops. The girl was dressed
jauntily in blue, and I wore my last year&#8217;s best suit and
a hat and collar. I sniffed the city smell, and declared,
&#8220;Rather nice, just for a contrast. I&#8217;ve got an all-dressed-up-in-my-best
feeling. Have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a lark,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;I never saw a city from
the country point of view before. It seems queer to me&#8211;as
if I didn&#8217;t belong in it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t,&#8221; said I; &#8220;you belong in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said nothing, but led me into a shop. It was a
household-goods shop, and here we looked at dishes
first. The woman who waited on us assumed a motherly
air. It began to dawn upon me that she thought we
were stocking our little prospective home. I shot a
covert glance at the girl. Her eyes were twinkling, her
colour high. I said nothing, but pointed to the dinner
set I desired.</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s Royal Worcester,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it? I like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, look at it all you can now,&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;for you can&#8217;t have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk laughed. &#8220;You see what you&#8217;re in for,
young man,&#8221; she said, with the familiarity which
rather too often characterizes clerks in our semi-rural
regions.</p>

<p>I fear I coloured more than Miss Goodwin, which
didn&#8217;t help matters any.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please show us something at a reasonable cost,&#8221; the
girl said, with a curious, dignified severity, which was
effective.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do, won&#8217;t it, Mr. Upton?&#8221; she presently
asked, with pointed emphasis on the formal address, as
a pretty set of dishes with a simple pattern on the edge
was displayed for $25.</p>

<p>&#8220;Admirably,&#8221; said I. &#8220;But I wanted the crimson
and gold ones.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>&#8220;Now for the kitchen things,&#8221; said she, with her old
smile again.</p>

<p>Here we made use of Mrs. Bert&#8217;s list, and left our
order to be filled. As we stepped out on the street, we
looked at each other, and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s preposterous, but I suppose the evidence is
against us,&#8221; she twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The evidence is against us, at any rate,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>She looked away quickly, and said, &#8220;Where is the
furniture store?&#8221;</p>

<p>We found it, and here we looked at iron beds for Mrs.
Pillig and son Peter, and for one of the spare rooms so
that I might have a guest up after college closed. She
let me have the bed I wanted for the spare room, but the
other two had to be plainer&#8211;or rather less plain, for the
cheaper furniture is, the more jimcracky it appears to be.
I asked the clerk why simplicity is always expensive,
but he threw no light on the point. Next we bought a
few cheap bedroom chairs, and a cheap bureau for Mrs.
Pillig, and a better bureau for the spare room. I
bought no other furniture, preferring to wait till I could
get to New York or Boston, or better yet pick up old
mahogany at country auctions, which I then believed
in my ignorance was possible. Then we invaded the
dry-goods shop, where again I stood helplessly by while
the girl bought bedding and tablecloths and napkins
and dishcloths and towels.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you haven&#8217;t any decent towels,&#8221; she said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
&#8220;because you&#8217;ve been a bachelor so long, and sent &#8217;em
to laundries. I send mine to laundries, too. That&#8217;s
how I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stood by helplessly, but not without emotion.
Many emotions are possible to a man while watching a
woman shop, the most common, perhaps, being impatience.
Your average woman shopping is the epitome
of irresolution, or so it seems to the man. She always
explains the huge pile of goods, which she compels
the poor clerk to heap on the counter, by an alleged
desire to get the most for her money&#8211;though she almost
invariably comes back to the first thing exhibited and
buys that in the end. A mere man buys the first thing
he likes then and there. But my companion was not
the usual woman shopper. She wanted towels of a certain
grade, for instance, inspected them, and if they were
up to her standard bought them without further to-do.
At my enthusiastic comments she smiled. &#8220;That&#8217;s because
it is your money I&#8217;m spending. I don&#8217;t have to
count the pennies!&#8221;</p>

<p>No, my emotion was not one of impatience. Indeed,
I should have liked to prolong the process. It was one
which only a man with his bachelor days fresh in mind
can understand. It was the subtle thrill of being led
helpless by a woman who is intent on providing him
creature comforts which he could not arrange for himself,
of seeing her purchase for him the most intimate
of domestic necessities, and inevitably filling his mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
with thoughts of her in his establishment. If I were a
woman and wanted to win a man, I should make him
take me shopping when he needed new towels!</p>

<p>We finished in the dry-goods store at last, and I said,
&#8220;I am sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;with every purchase you
make for me, you lay a new brick in the structure of
our friendship&#8211;or a new towel!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her face quickly away, and made no
reply.</p>

<p>Our next quest was for a sundial plate, but it was a
vain search, for not a store in town carried such an
article. As we came out of the last shop, she sighed.
&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t spend any more of your money!&#8221; she
said. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve really saved it for you. Goodness
knows how much you&#8217;d have spent by yourself. Why,
you wanted the most expensive kind of <i>everything</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said I; &#8220;nothing is too good for Twin
Fires.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s lucky I was along, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky isn&#8217;t just the word,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I feel already
as if Twin Fires was as much yours as mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she made no reply, except to ask when the
train went back. But the train had long since gone
back. It was nearly two o&#8217;clock, and we realized that
we were hungry. So we gayly hunted out the hotel, and
here I took command. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to order this lunch,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
I declared, &#8220;and the expense go hang. We&#8217;ll have a
regular spree, cocktails and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hotel was really a good one, and the presence of
several motor parties gave the caf√© almost a metropolitan
appearance. The change from Mrs. Bert&#8217;s simple
service to this was abrupt, and we were in the highest
spirits. The cocktails came, and we clinked glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Twin Fires!&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the fairy godmother of Twin Fires!&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Our eyes met as our glasses touched, and something
electric passed between us. Then we drank.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my first cocktail,&#8221; she laughed, as she set
her glass down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;and we in a public place!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was my first since I came to Bentford, and we
both enjoyed the luxury of dissipation, and laughed
brazenly at our enjoyment. Then the lunch came, and
we enjoyed that, and then we caught a train, and
half an hour later were walking toward the farm. We
passed the golf links on the way, at the end of the beautiful,
elm-hung main street of Bentford, and saw players
striding over the green turf along the winding river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, drag me past!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Oh, Lord, lead
us not into temptation!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you joined yet?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t dare. I shan&#8217;t join till the farm is in
running order. The game is like Brand&#8217;s conscience,
it demands all or nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>&#8220;You men are dreadful babies about your sports,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;quite so. We haven&#8217;t the firm-mindedness
of your sex, about bridge, for instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never played a game of bridge in my life,&#8221; said
she indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t thinking of you, but your sex,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You find a difference?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Decidedly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what Sentimental Tommy told every
woman he met.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except Grizel&#8211;of whom it was true.&#8221; I looked
at her keenly, and she cast down her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;A farmer shouldn&#8217;t talk in literary allusions,&#8221; she
said softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I laughed, &#8220;they&#8217;ve got me past the golf
links!&#8221;</p>

<p>We reached Twin Fires, and walked out to see if the
roses were all alive, though they hadn&#8217;t had time to die.
Then I went into the house to work, and she gathered
a few sprays of lilac, and while I was settling down at my
desk she arranged them in water and stood them on the
mantels, humming to herself. Then she turned to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>She looked at me with a little smile, as if of query.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been such a nice day,&#8221; I added, &#8220;and it&#8217;s so
pleasant to feel you here in the house. Please strum
something while I work.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>&#8220;For ten minutes,&#8221; she replied, sitting down at the
piano. &#8220;Then I must work, too&#8211;horrid letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose presently, while I was scarce aware of it,
and slipped out. I worked on, in silence save for the
talk of the painters putting aside their brushes after the
day&#8217;s work. But I could smell the lilacs she had left,
and the scent of them seemed like the wraith of her
presence in the sunny room.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span><a id='link_13'></a>Chapter XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE ADVENT OF THE PILLIGS</span></h2>

<p>The next day the painters left for good. Hard
Cider had completed his tasks, Mike had no further
need for his son Joe till haying time, and I no longer
had an excuse for putting off my departure from Bert&#8217;s
and my embarkation upon the dubious seas of housekeeping
with Mrs. Pillig at the wheel and son Peter as
cabin boy. So I sent word to Mrs. Pillig to be ready
to come the next morning, asked Mrs. Bert to order for
me the necessary stock of groceries from the village, and
gave myself up to the joys of transplanting. It was a
cloudy day, with rain threatening, so that Mike assured
me I could not find a better time. Miss Goodwin
worked by my side, her task consisting of a careful
perusal of the seed catalogue and a planting table.
What colour were the flowers? How far apart should
the plants be set? How tall did they grow? My ignorance
was as profound as hers. But perhaps that
added to the pleasure. It did to mine, at any rate. I
was experimenting with the unknown.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve set many a seedling since and needed no table
to tell me how, but I have never recaptured quite the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
glee of that soft, cloudy June morning, when my shiny
new trowel transferred unknown plants to the flats on
the wheelbarrow, and a voice beside me read:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;<i>Phlox Drummondi</i>. This is one of the finest annuals,
being hardy, easy of cultivation, and making as a
summer bedding plant an effective and brilliant display.
The flowers are of long duration and of most
gorgeous and varied colours. One foot. One fourth
ounce, special mixture; contains all the finest and most
brilliant colours.&#8217; Wait, now, P&#8211;ph&#8211;phlox&#8211;my, this
is like the dictionary! Here we are! Plant twelve
inches apart. My goodness, if you plant all those
twelve inches apart, you&#8217;ll fill the whole farm! Where
are you going to put them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not around the sundial?&#8221; said I. &#8220;They
appear to be low and of a superlative variety of brilliant
colour. And they&#8217;re an old-fashioned posy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is superlative in a seed catalogue, I
observe,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;Peter Bell could never have
written a successful catalogue, could he? Yes, I think
they&#8217;d be lovely round the sundial, with something tall
on the outside, in clumps. Something white, like the
pillar, to show them off.&#8221;</p>

<p>We wheeled out the phlox plants and set them in the
circular beds ringing the sundial, working on boards
laid down on the ground, for my grass seed was sprouting,
if rather spindly and in patches. Then we returned
for something tall and white. Alas! we went over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
catalogue once, twice, three times, but there was nothing
in my seed bed which would do! The stock was
little higher than the phlox. White annual larkspur
would have served, if there had been any&#8211;but there
wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the last time anybody else ever picks my seeds
for me!&#8221; I declared. &#8220;Gee, I&#8217;ll know a few things by
next year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, but you must fill up those sundial beds, <i>this</i>
year,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Oh, dear, I did want some tall
clumps of white on the outside!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here are asters. Asters are white, sometimes.
See if these are. Giant comet, that sounds rather
exciting. Also, d√©butante. They ought to be showy.
Most d√©butantes are nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>She scanned my box of empty seed envelopes. &#8220;Oh,
dear, the giant comets are mixed,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But&#8221;&#8211;with
a look at the catalogue&#8211;&#8220;the d√©butantes are white.
They grow only a foot and a half, but they are white.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ll have to fox trot round the dial, then,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>I dug them up, and we put them in clumps in the
irregularities on the outside edges of the beds, first
filling the holes part full of water, as I had seen Mike do
with the cauliflower plants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me do some,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;Here I&#8217;ve been
reading the old catalogue all the morning, while you&#8217;ve
been digging in the nice dirt.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>She kneeled on the board, holding a plant caressingly
in her hand, and with her naked fingers set it and firmed
it in the moist earth. Then she set a second, and a
third, holding up her grimy fingers gleefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you nice earth!&#8221; she finally exclaimed, digging
both hands eagerly in to the wrists.</p>

<p>After dinner we spaded up little beds at the foot of
each pillar of the rose arch, and put flowers in each of
them, facing the house, set a row of <i>Phlox Drummondi</i>
along the line where the grape arbour was to be, to mark
more clearly the western edge of the lawn, and finally
took a load of the remaining seedlings, of various sorts,
down to the brook, just below the orchard, where I
planned some day to build a pool and develop a lovely
garden nook. Here the soil was black and rich for a
foot or more in depth, and after spading and raking out
the weeds and grasses we had four little beds, though
roughly and hastily made, two on each side of the
stream, with the future pool, as it were, in the centre.
These we filled with the remaining seedlings, helter
skelter, just for a splash of colour, and watered from the
brook itself.</p>

<p>Then we straightened our stiff backs, and scurried for
shelter from the coming rain. We reached Bert&#8217;s just
as the first big drops began to fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice rain!&#8221; she cried, turning to look at it from under
the porch. &#8220;You&#8217;ll give all the flowers a drink, and
they&#8217;ll live and be beautiful in the garden of Twin Fires.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>&#8220;Do you like flowers as well as philology, really?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s to prevent my liking both,&#8221; she
smiled, as she disappeared up the stairs.</p>

<p>The next day it was still raining. I set off alone to
make ready for the arrival of the Pilligs. I was standing
on my kitchen porch talking to Mike when they arrived.
It was a memorable moment. I heard the sound of
wheels, and looked up. A wagon was approaching, driven
by an old man. Beside him, beneath a cotton umbrella,
sat a thin woman in black, with gray hair and a worried
look. Behind them, on a battered trunk, sat Peter, who
was not thin, who wore no worried look, and who chewed
gum. Beneath the wagon, invisible at first, trotted a
mud-bespattered yellow pup. The wagon stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Upton,&#8221; said Mrs. Pillig. &#8220;This
is me and Peter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Buster?&#8221; said Peter.</p>

<p>At the word Buster, the yellow pup emerged from
beneath the cart, wagging the longest tail, in proportion
to the dog, ever seen on a canine. It would be more
correct to say that the tail wagged him, for with every
excited motion his whole body was undulated to the ears,
to counterbalance that tail.</p>

<p>I went out and aided Mrs. Pillig to alight, and then
Mike and I lifted the trunk to the porch. I looked at
the dog, which had also joined us on the porch, where he
was leaving muddy paw marks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>&#8220;Do I understand that Buster is also an arrival?&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me, Mr. Upton, you must excuse me,&#8221;
Mrs. Pillig cried anxiously. &#8220;Mrs. John Barker&#8217;s boy
Leslie gave Buster to Peter a month ago, and of course I
sent him right back, but he wouldn&#8217;t stay back, and
yesterday we took him away again, and this morning he
just suddenly appeared behind the wagon, and I told
Peter he couldn&#8217;t come, and Peter cried, and Buster
wouldn&#8217;t go back, and I&#8217;ll make Peter take him away
just as soon as the rain stops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hadn&#8217;t bargained on Buster, that&#8217;s a fact,&#8221;
said I. I didn&#8217;t like dogs; most people don&#8217;t who&#8217;ve
never had one. But he was such a forlornly muddy
mongrel pup, and so eloquent of tail, that I spoke his name
on an impulse, and put out my hand. The great tail wagged
him to the ears, and with the friendliest of undulations
he was all at once close to me, with his nose in my
palm. Then he suddenly sat up on his hind legs, dangled
his front paws, looked me square in the eyes, and barked.</p>

<p>That was too much for me. &#8220;Peter,&#8221; said I, &#8220;you
may keep Buster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly, I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; had a hard time not to,&#8221; said that
young person, immediately making for the barn, with
Buster at his heels.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pillig and I went inside. While she was inspecting
the kitchen, Mike and I carried her trunk up
the back stairs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>&#8220;I hope your bed comes to-day,&#8221; said I, returning.
&#8220;You see, the house is largely furnished from my two
rooms at college, and there was hardly enough to go
around.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pillig looked into the south room. &#8220;Did you
have all them books in your two rooms at college?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must &#8217;a&#8217; been pretty big rooms,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Books is awful things to keep dusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which reminds me,&#8221; I smiled, leading her over to
my desk, at which I pointed impressively. &#8220;Woman!&#8221;
said I, in sepulchral tones, &#8220;that desk is never to be
dusted, never to be touched. Not a paper is to be removed
from it. No matter how dirty, how littered it
gets, <i>never touch it under pain of death!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me a second with her worried eyes wide
open, and then a smile came over her wan, thin face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you be n&#8217;t so terrible as you sound,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But I won&#8217;t touch it. Anything else I&#8217;m not to
touch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;The ashes in those two fireplaces.
<i>The ashes there are never to be taken out</i>, no
matter if they are piled a foot thick, and spill all over the
floor. A noble pile of ashes is a room&#8217;s best recommendation.
Those are the only two orders I have. In
all else, I&#8217;m at your mercy. But on those two points
you are at mine&#8211;and I have none!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>&#8220;Well, I reckon I&#8217;ll wash the kitchen windows,&#8221; said
Mrs. Pillig.</p>

<p>I was sawing up a few more sticks from the orchard,
when the express man drove up with the beds, the
crockery, and so on. I called son Peter, who responded
with Buster at his heels. &#8220;Peter,&#8221; said I, &#8220;you and I&#8217;ll
now set up the beds. You ought to be in school, though,
by the way. Why aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hed ter bring maw over here,&#8221; said Peter.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad. Aren&#8217;t you sorry?&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter grinned at me and slowly winked. I was very
stern. &#8220;Nevertheless, you&#8217;ll have a lesson,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;You shall tell me the capitals of all the states while we
set up your bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter and I carried the beds, springs, and mattresses
upstairs, and while we were joining the frames I began
with Massachusetts and made him tell me all the capitals
he could. We got into a dispute over the capital
of Montana, Peter maintaining it was Butte, and I
defending Helena. The debate waxed warm, and suddenly
Buster appeared upon the scene, his tail following
him up the stairs, to see what the trouble was. He began
to leave mud tracks all over the freshly painted
floor, so that we had to grab him up and wipe his paws
with a rag. Peter held him while I wiped, and we fell to
laughing, and forgot Montana.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to get rubbers for him,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>This idea amused Peter tremendously. &#8220;Gee,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
rubbers on a dog!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Buster&#8217;d eat &#8217;em off in two
seconds. Say, where&#8217;s Buster goin&#8217; to sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>We had to turn aside on our way downstairs for more
furniture to make Buster a bed in a box full of excelsior
in the shed. We put him in it, and went back to the
porch. Buster followed us. We took him back, and
put him in the box once more. He whacked the sides
with his tail, as if he enjoyed the game&#8211;and jumped
out as soon as we turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, he&#8217;s too wide awake now,&#8221; said Peter.</p>

<p>So we fell over Buster for the rest of the morning. I
never saw a dog before nor since who could so successfully
get under your feet as Buster. If I started upstairs
with the frame of a pine bureau on my back,
Buster was on the third step, between my legs. If I was
carrying in a stack of plates from the barrel of crockery,
Buster was wedged in the screen door, pushing it open
ahead of me, to let it snap back in my face. When I
scolded him, he undulated his silly yellow body, sprang
upon his hind legs, and licked my hands. If I tried to
kick him, he regarded it as a game, and bit my shoe
lace. Peter&#8217;s shoe laces, I noted, were in shreds. But
Buster disappeared after a time, and Peter and I got
the china and kitchenware all in, and Mrs. Pillig had
it washed and in the cupboards before he reappeared.
He came down the front stairs with one of my bath
slippers in his mouth, and, with a profoundly proud
undulation of tail and body, laid it at my feet for me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
to throw, barking loudly. We all laughed, but I took
the slipper and beat him with it, while Peter appeared
on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Buster,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;You keep out of doors.
Peter, put him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter resentfully deposited the pup on the porch, and
took my slipper back upstairs. Meanwhile, Buster,
after looking wistfully through the screen door a second,
pushed it open with his nose and paw and re√´ntered,
immediately sitting up on his hind legs and gazing into
my eyes with the most human look I ever saw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buster,&#8221; said I, &#8220;you are the limit. Very well,
stay in. I give up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster plopped down on all fours, as if he understood
perfectly, and took a bite at my shoe string. I patted
his head. I had to. The pup was irresistible.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what time will you have your dinner?&#8221; asked
Mrs. Pillig. &#8220;There&#8217;s no meat in the house. Guess
you forgot to order the butcher to stop; but there&#8217;s
eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eggs will do,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and one o&#8217;clock. Bert has
his at twelve, but I want mine at one. Maybe I shall
have a guest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A guest!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be puttin&#8217; a
guest on me the first mornin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s doubtful, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Perhaps
I&#8217;ll wait till to-morrow night, and have three
guests for supper&#8211;just Bert and his wife and their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
boarder&#8211;sort of a housewarming, you know. I want
you to make a pie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I reckon I can wait on table stylish enough for
Mrs. Temple,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll make a lemon pie
that&#8217;ll make Bert Temple sorry he didn&#8217;t marry <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t want you to wreck Bert&#8217;s domestic
happiness,&#8221; said I, &#8220;but make the pie, just the same!&#8221;</p>

<p>I went into the south room, and sat at my desk
answering some letters, while I waited for dinner. I
could hear the rattle of dishes in the kitchen&#8211;the first
of those humble domestic sounds which we associate
with the word home. Through the house, too, and in
to me, floated the aroma of bacon and of coffee, faintly,
just detectable, mingled with the smell of earth under
June rain, which drifted through an open window.
Presently I heard the front door open very softly. As
I guessed that Peter had his instructions in behaviour
from his mother, I knew it must be Miss Goodwin.
My pen poised suspended over the paper. I waited
for her to enter the room, in a pleasant tingle of expectation.
But she did not enter. Several minutes
passed, and I got up to investigate, but there was no
sign of her. The front door, however, stood ajar.
Then Mrs. Pillig called &#8220;Dinner!&#8221;</p>

<p>I walked into my dining-room, and sat down at the
table, which was covered with a new tablecloth and
adorned with my new china. Beside my plate was the
familiar, old-fashioned silver I had eaten with when a
boy, and the sight of it thrilled me. Then I spied the
centrepiece&#8211;a glass vase bearing three fresh iris buds
from the brookside. Here was the secret, then, of the
open door! Mrs. Pillig came in with the platter of
eggs and bacon, and she, too, spied the flowers.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i3'></a><img src='images/illus-174.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;Well, well, you&#8217;ve got yourself a bookay,&#8221; she said
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>&#8220;Well, well, you&#8217;ve got yourself a bookay,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; was my answer. &#8220;They just came. Mrs.
Pillig, there&#8217;s a fairy lives in this house, a nice, thoughtful
fairy, who does things like this. If you ever see
her, don&#8217;t be frightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pillig looked at me pityingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring your
toast and coffee now,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The coffee came in steaming, and it was good coffee,
much better than Mrs. Bert&#8217;s. The eggs were good,
too. But best of all was the centrepiece. She had
come in so softly, and gone so quickly, and nobody had
seen her! She had been present at my first meal in
Twin Fires, after all, and so delicately present, just
in the subtle fragrance of flowers and the warm token
of thoughtfulness! My meal was a very happy one,
happier even, perhaps, than it would have been had
she sat opposite me in person. We are curious creatures,
who can on occasion extract a sweeter pleasure
from our dreams of others in loneliness than from their
bodily presence. Mrs. Pillig fluttered in and out, to
see if I was faring well, and though her service was not
that of a trained waitress it sufficed to bring me dessert
of some canned peaches, buried under my own rich
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
cream, and to remind me that my wants were solicitously
cared for. Out on the porch I could see Peter
playing with Buster and hear that ingratiating pup&#8217;s
yelps of canine delight. Before me stood the purple
iris blooms, with golden hearts just opening, their
slender stems rising from the clear water in the vase,
and spoke of her whose thought of me was so gracious,
so delicately expressed, so warming to my heart. The
spoon I held bore my mother&#8217;s initials, reminding me of
my childhood, of that other home which death had
broken up ten years before, since when I had called no
place home save my study and bedroom high above
the college Yard. I thought of the Yard&#8211;pleasantly,
but without regrets. I looked through the window as
my last spoonful of dessert was eaten, and saw the sky
breaking into blue. I folded my new napkin, put it
into the old silver ring which bore the word &#8220;John&#8221; on
the side, failed utterly to note the absence of a finger-bowl,
and rose from my first meal in Twin Fires.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a home again,&#8221; said I, aloud; &#8220;I have a home
again after ten years!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I went up the road toward Bert&#8217;s.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span><a id='link_14'></a>Chapter XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FIRST LEMON PIE</span></h2>

<p>Miss Goodwin was not there. She had gone for
a walk. Disappointed, I went back to my farm, and
resolved to clean up the path through the pines, to
surprise her. The grove was dripping wet, the brook
high, and when I had stacked up the slash from as far
as the tamarack swamp, I brought down some old
planks from the house and made a walk with them over
the wet corner. There was scarcely any slash in the
open border of pines along the south wall, so that I had
time to smooth with a rake the path on between the
vegetables and the hayfield well back toward the house,
mow it out with a scythe across the little slope of
neglected grass just west of the house, where I was going
some day to plant more orchard and place my
chicken houses, and finally bring it down sharp through
the group of pines by the road just northwest of the
woodshed (evidently planted there for a windbreak),
ending it up at the driveway which led in to the vegetable
garden, around the end of the shed. Then I put
up my tools, and walked back proudly around the circle.
The path practically encompassed ten acres, so that it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
made quite a respectable stroll. First, it led west
through the small group of pines, then south along the
wall by the potato field, where I glimpsed the rows of
sprouting plants, and beyond them the lone pine and
the acres of Bert&#8217;s farm and the far hills up the valley.
Then it led by the hayfield wall, on the right a tangle
of wild roses and other wallside flowers and weeds, on
the left the neat rows of my vegetables, with the peas
already brushed. At the end of the farm it turned
east, between two rows of pine trunks like a natural
cloister, and finally entered the tamarack swamp, and
then the hush and silence of the pine grove, where the
brook ran along in its mossy bed and you might have
been miles from any house. It emerged into the maples
where Twin Fires was visible, spick and span with new
white paint and green shutters, above its orchard. I
was very proud of that path, of its length, its charm,
its variety, its spontaneous character. It seemed
to me then, and it has never ceased to seem, better
than any extended acres of formal garden planting,
more truly representative of the natural landscape of
our country, and so in a truer sense a real garden.
There are spots along that brook now where I have
sown ferns and wild flowers from the deep woods,
brought home, like the trilliums, in a grapevine basket,
spots which for sheer exquisiteness of shadowed water
and shy bloom and delicate green beat any formal bed
you ever dreamed. I have even cleared out three trees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
to let the morning sun fall on a little pool by the brook,
and into that place I have succeeded in transplanting a
cardinal flower, which looks at its own reflection in the
still water below, across the pool from a blue vervain.
Just one cardinal flower&#8211;that is all&#8211;under a shaft
of sunlight in the woods. But it is, I like to think,
what Hiroshige would most enjoy.</p>

<p>However, I am running ahead of my story. Returning
to the house, I went up to my new chamber,
where my striped Navajo blanket (a gift from a New
Mexican undergraduate who had been in one of my
courses and entertained an inexplicable regard for me,
possibly because I persuaded him that he was not destined
for a literary career) was spread on the floor, my
old college bed was clean with fresh linen, and my college
shingles hung on the walls, a pleasant reminder of
those strange social ambitions which mean so much to
youth. Through my west window streamed in the
sunset. I peeled off my clothes and dove into my
brand new and quite too expensive porcelain bath tub&#8211;a
luxury Bert&#8217;s house did not possess. Then I got
into my good clothes and a starched collar, more for
the now novel sensation than anything else, ate my
supper, and in the warm June evening walked up the
road.</p>

<p>Bert and his wife were in the front sitting-room. I
could see them beneath the hanging lamp. The girl
was walking idly up and down before the house. Out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
of range of the open window I took her hand and gave
it a little pressure. &#8220;For the centrepiece,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;You sat opposite me at my first meal, bless you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221; she answered. &#8220;What are you talking
about?&#8221; She smiled it off, but I knew that she was
pleased at my pleasure.</p>

<p>Then I led the way into the parlour. &#8220;Hear, ye;
hear, ye; hear, ye!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;To-morrow night at seven
a housewarming dinner-party will be given at Twin
Fires. The guests will be Mrs. Bert Temple, her lesser
fraction, and Miss Stella Goodwin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Land o&#8217; Goshen!&#8221; said Mrs. Bert. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t got no
fit clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bert and I roared. &#8220;They&#8217;re all alike,&#8221; cried Bert
to me. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t got no fit clothes, neither, hev you,
Miss Goodwin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;But I expect to
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I ain&#8217;t got no swaller tail myself,&#8221; said Bert.
&#8220;But I expect to go. We&#8217;ll jest leave the old lady ter
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you, now?&#8221; said she. &#8220;Do you s&#8217;pose I&#8217;d lose
a chance to see how Mrs. Pillig&#8217;s feedin&#8217; our friend?
Not much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven o&#8217;clock, then!&#8221; I called, as I went back down
the road, to light my old student&#8217;s lamp again at last,
and labour in my own house in the quiet evening, the
time of day the Lord appointed for mental toil. As I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
drew near, the form of Buster emerged from the shed,
barking savagely, his bark changing to whimpers of
joy as I spoke his name. He pleaded to come into the
house with me, so I let him come, and all the evening he
lay on the rug beside my chair, while I worked. Now
and then I leaned to stroke his head, whereupon he
would roll over on his back, raise his four paws into
the air, and present his white belly to be scratched.
When I stopped, he would roll back with a grunt of profound
satisfaction, bat one eye at me affectionately,
and go to sleep again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buster,&#8221; said I, &#8220;hanged if I don&#8217;t like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>His great tail spanked the rug.</p>

<p>The house seemed oddly more companionable for
his presence. Yes, I did like him&#8211;I who had thought
I hated dogs! I put him to bed at eleven, in the woodshed,
and bade him good-night aloud.</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Pillig was nervously busy with
preparations for the feast. The ice man came, and the
butcher. I worked half the day at my manuscripts,
and half cleaning up the last of my orchard slash,
mowing the neglected grass with a scythe, and trimming
the grass between the house and the road with a lawn
mower. I also edged the path to the kitchen door.
Every few moments I looked up the road toward Bert&#8217;s,
but no figure drew near with saucily tilted nose. There
was only Buster, trotting hither and yon in every part
of the landscape, and, at half-past three, the chunky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
form of Peter coming home from the Slab City school.
I set Peter to work for an hour sawing wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I gotter study,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spellin&#8217;,&#8221; said Peter.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask you words while you saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave me his book which I held open on the lawnmower
handle, and every time the machine came to his
end of the strip of lawn I asked him a new word. Then
I&#8217;d mow back again, and he&#8217;d make another cut of
apple bough, and then we&#8217;d have a fresh word.</p>

<p>&#8220;This lends an extremely educational aspect to
agricultural toil, Peter,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Peter had his lesson learned and I had the lawn
mowed by five o&#8217;clock. I devoted the next hour to my
correspondence, and then went up to make myself
ready for the feast. For some reason I went into the
spare room at the front of the house, and glancing from
the window saw Miss Stella stealing up through the
orchard, her hands full of flowers. I watched cautiously.
She peeped into the east window, saw that the coast was
clear, and I heard the front door gently opened. I tiptoed
to the head of the stairs, and listened. She was in
the south room. Presently I heard voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh,&#8221; she was cautioning, evidently to Mrs. Pillig.
A second later I heard Buster bark his &#8220;stranger-coming!&#8221;
bark by the kitchen door. When I came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
downstairs, there were fresh flowers beneath the Hiroshiges,
a bowl of them on the piano, and a centrepiece
in the dining-room. I smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That fairy&#8217;s been here again,&#8221; said Mrs. Pillig slyly.
&#8220;Gave me quite a start.&#8221;</p>

<p>Promptly at seven my guests arrived, and I ushered
them with great ceremony into the south room, where
Mrs. Bert gazed around with unfeigned delight, and
cried, &#8220;Well, land o&#8217; Goshen, to think this was them
two old stuffy rooms of Milt&#8217;s, with nothin&#8217; in &#8217;em but a
bed and a cracked pitcher! Hev you read all them
books, young man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite all,&#8221; I laughed, as I opened the chimney
cupboard to the left of my west fireplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky you read what you did before you began ter
run a farm,&#8221; said Bert.</p>

<p>I now brought forth from the cupboard a bottle of my
choicest Bourbon and four glasses. The ladies consented
to the tiniest sip, but, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; stingy
about me!&#8221; said Bert. &#8220;Here&#8217;s to yer, Mr. Upton, and
to yer house!&#8221;</p>

<p>We set our glasses down just as Mrs. Pillig announced
dinner. On the way across the hall I managed to touch
the girl&#8217;s hand once more. &#8220;For the second centrepiece,
dear fairy,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>Bert was in rare form that evening, and kept us in
gales of merriment. Mrs. Pillig brought the soup and
meat with anxious gravity, set the courses on the table,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
and then stopped to chat with Mrs. Temple, or to listen
to Bert&#8217;s stories. She amused me almost as much as
Bert did. Bert and his wife weren&#8217;t company to her,
and the impersonal attitude of a servant was quite
impossible for her. It was a family party with the waitress
included. Miss Goodwin and I exchanged glances
of amusement across the table.</p>

<p>Then came the lemon pie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now there&#8217;s a pie!&#8221; said Mrs. Pillig, setting it
proudly before me.</p>

<p>I picked up my mother&#8217;s old silver pie knife and carefully
sank it down through the two-inch mass of puffy
brown m√©ringue spangled with golden drops, the under
layer of lemon-yellow body, and finally the flaky, marvellously
dry and tender bottom crust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Pillig,&#8221; said I, &#8220;pie is right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marthy,&#8221; said Bert, smacking his lips over the first
mouthful, &#8220;if you could make a pie like this, you&#8217;d be
perfect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The creation of a pie like this,&#8221; said I, &#8220;transcends
the achievements of Praxiteles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could make a pie like this,&#8221; said Miss Goodwin,
&#8220;I should resign from the dictionary and open a bakeshop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pillig stood in the doorway, her thin, worried
face wreathed in smiles. Under her elbow I saw Peter
peeping through, less curious concerning us, I fancied,
than the fate of the pie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>&#8220;You lose, Peter,&#8221; I called. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t going to
be no core.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the sound of my voice Buster came squeezing into
the room, and put his forepaws in my lap. Then he
went around the table greeting everybody, and ended
by nestling his nose against Miss Goodwin&#8217;s knee. I
slid back my chair, supremely content. Bert slid back
his. I reached to the mantel for a box of cigars and
passed one to Bert, along with a candle, for I had no
lamp in the dining-room as yet, nor any candles for the
table. That was a little detail we had forgotten. Bert
bit off the end, and puffed contentedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s some seegar,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Better&#8217;n I&#8217;m used
ter. Speakin&#8217; o&#8217; seegars, though, reminds me o&#8217; old
Jedge Perkins, when he went to Williams College. They
used ter what yer call haze in them days, an&#8217; the soph&#8217;mores,
they come into the young Jedge&#8217;s room to
smoke him out, an&#8217; they give him a dollar an&#8217; told
him to go buy pipes an&#8217; terbacker; so he went out
an&#8217; come back with ninety-nine clay pipes an&#8217; a penny&#8217;s
worth o&#8217; terbacker, an&#8217; it pleased the soph&#8217;mores
so they let him off. &#8217;Least, that&#8217;s what the Jedge
said.&#8221;</p>

<p>We rose and went back into the south room, followed
by Buster. Bert was puffing his cigar with deep delight,
and sank into the depths of a Morris chair, stretching
out his feet. &#8220;Say, Marthy, why don&#8217;t we hev a chair
like this?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>&#8220;&#8217;Cause you can&#8217;t stay awake in a straight one,&#8221; she
replied.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bert wandered about the room inspecting my
books and pictures like a curious child. Miss Stella
and I watched them both for a moment, exchanging a
happy smile that meant volumes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you invited them,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you are here, too, though,&#8221; I whispered
back. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of my housewarming now, without
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She coloured rosily, and moved to the piano, where,
by some right instinct, she began to play Stephen Foster.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Old Kentucky Home!&#8217; By jinks, Marthy, do yer
hear thet? Remember how I courted you, with the
Salem Cadet Band a-playin&#8217; thet tune out on the bandstand,
an&#8217; us in the shadder of a lilac bush?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha Temple blushed like a girl. &#8220;Hush up,
Bert,&#8221; she laughed. But she went over and sat on the
arm of the Morris chair beside him, and I saw his big,
brown, calloused hand steal about her waist. My own
instinct was to go to the piano, and I followed it, bending
over the player and whispering close to her ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve touched a chord in their hearts,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;that you couldn&#8217;t have reached with Bach or Mozart.
Don&#8217;t stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old dears,&#8221; she whispered back. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give
them &#8217;The Old Folks at Home.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>She did, holding the last chord open till the sound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
died away in the heart of the piano, and the room was
still. Then suddenly she slipped into &#8220;The Camptown
Races,&#8221; and Bert, with a loud shout of delight,
began to beat out the rhythm on Martha&#8217;s ample hip,
for his arm was still about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;By cricky,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I bet thet tune beats any o&#8217;
these new-fangled turkey trots! Speakin&#8217; o&#8217; turkey
trots, Marthy, you and me ain&#8217;t been to a dance in a
year. We mus&#8217; go ter the next one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like to dance?&#8221; asked Miss Goodwin,
coming over to the settle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, now, when I was young, I was some hand at
the lancers,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Used ter drive over ter
Orville in a big sleigh full o&#8217; hay, an&#8217; hev a dance an&#8217;
oyster stew to the hotel thar. Sarah Pillig wuz some
tripper in them days, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, ha!&#8221; said I, &#8220;now I see why Mrs. Temple was
so anxious to come to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff!&#8221; said that amiable woman.</p>

<p>The girl was looking into the ashes on the hearth.
&#8220;Sleigh rides!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I suppose you all go jingling
about the lovely country in sleighs all winter! Do you
know, I never had a sleigh ride in my life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; cried Bert. &#8220;Don&#8217;t seem possible. Speakin&#8217;
o&#8217; sleighs, did I ever tell you about old Deacon Temple,
my great uncle? He used ter hev a story he sprung on
anybody who&#8217;d listen. Cricky, how he did welcome a
stranger ter town! &#8217;Cordin&#8217; ter this story, he wuz
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
once drivin&#8217; along on a fine crust, when his old hoss run
away, an&#8217; run, an&#8217; run, an&#8217; finally upset the sleigh over a
wall into a hayfield whar they was mowin&#8217;, an&#8217; he fell
in a haycock an&#8217; didn&#8217;t hurt himself at all. Then the
stranger would say: &#8217;But how could they be mowin&#8217; in
Massachusetts in sleighin&#8217; time?&#8217; and the Deacon would
answer: &#8217;They wa&#8217;n&#8217;t. The old mare run so far she
run into Rhode Island.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple rose. &#8220;Bert, you come home,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;before you think of any more o&#8217; them old ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, jest the woodchuck,&#8221; Bert pleaded.</p>

<p>Miss Stella and I insisted on the woodchuck, so Bert
sank back luxuriously, and narrated the tale. It had
happened, it seems, to his grandfather and this same
brother, the Deacon, when they were boys. &#8220;The
old place wuz down by the river,&#8221; said Bert, &#8220;an&#8217; there
was a pesky &#8217;chuck they couldn&#8217;t shoot ner trap, he
wuz so smart, who hed a burrow near the bank. So
one day grandad seen him go in, an&#8217; he called the Deacon,
an&#8217; the two of &#8217;em sot out ter drown the critter.
They lugged water in pails, takin&#8217; turns watchin&#8217; and
luggin&#8217;, for two hours, dumpin&#8217; it into the hole till she
was nigh full up. Then they got too tuckered ter tote
any more, an&#8217; sat down behind a bush ter rest. Pretty
soon they seen the old woodchuck&#8217;s head poke up.
He looked around, careful like, but didn&#8217;t see the boys
behind the bush, so he come all the way out and what
do you think he done?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>&#8220;Tell us!&#8221; cried Miss Stella, leaning forward, her
eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;He went down ter the river an&#8217; took a drink,&#8221; said
Bert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you copy the wisdom of the woodchuck?&#8221;
I asked, when the laugh had subsided.</p>

<p>Bert nodded slyly and I opened my chimney cupboard
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s agin all laws,&#8221; said Bert, pointing a thumb
toward his wife, &#8220;but it ain&#8217;t every day we hev a noo
neighbour in these parts. Here&#8217;s to yer, once more!&#8221;</p>

<p>The four of us walked up the road in merry mood,
and the older folk left the girl and me on the porch.
She held the door open, as if to go in after them, but I
pleaded that the lovely June night was young. &#8220;And
so are we,&#8221; I added.</p>

<p>She looked at me a moment, through the dusk, and
then came out on the stoop. We moved across the
dewy lawn to a bench beneath the sycamore that
guarded the house, and sat down. Neither of us spoke
for a long moment. Then I said abruptly: &#8220;You&#8217;ve
only come to my house wearing a fairy cap of invisibility,
since I moved in&#8211;till to-night. Won&#8217;t you come
to-morrow and walk through the pines? I&#8217;ve cleared
all the slash out for you, and put planks in the swamp.
The thrush won&#8217;t sing for me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll come&#8211;for the last time,&#8221; she said softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why for the last time?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m going back to the I&#8217;s, or the J&#8217;s, on
the day after,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no, you mustn&#8217;t!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;You
must stay here with the jays. Why, you&#8217;re not strong
enough, and New York will be horribly hot, and you
haven&#8217;t seen the phlox in bloom yet round the sundial,
and you&#8217;ve got to tell me where to plant the perennials,
when I sow them, and&#8211;and&#8211;well, you just mustn&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled wistfully. &#8220;Pronunciation is more important
for me than perennials, if not so pleasant,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I shall think of Twin Fires often, though, in&#8211;in
the heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll arrest you if you try to wade in Central
Park,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She laughed softly, lifting the corners of her eyes to
mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; I maintained, &#8220;you are not well enough
to go back. You are just beginning to get strong
again. It&#8217;s folly, that&#8217;s what it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Strong! Why, my hands are as calloused as yours,&#8221;
she laughed, &#8220;and about as tanned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me feel,&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>She hesitated a second, and then put out her hand.
I took it in mine, and touched the palm. Then my
fingers closed over it, and I held it in silence, while
through the soft June night the music of far frogs came
to us, and the song of crickets in the grass. She did not
attempt to withdraw it for a long moment. The night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
noises, the night odours in the warm dark, wrapped us
about, as we sat close together on the bench. I turned
my face to hers, and saw that she was softly weeping.
Strange tears were very close to my own eyes. But I
did not speak. The hand slipped out of mine. She
rose, and we moved to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;The path to-morrow, at twilight,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>She nodded, not trusting to speech, and suddenly
she was gone.</p>

<p>I walked down the road to Twin Fires in a dream,
yet curiously aware of the rhythmic throb, the swell
and diminuendo, of the crickets&#8217; elfin chime.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span><a id='link_15'></a>Chapter XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A PAGAN THRUSH</span></h2>

<p>All that next June day I worked in my garden, in
a dream, my hands performing their tasks mechanically.
I ran the wheel hoe between the rows of newly
planted raspberries and blackberries, to mulch the soil,
without consciousness of the future fruit which was
supposed to delight me.</p>

<p>Avoiding Mike, who would have insisted on conversing
had I worked near him, I next went down to the
brook below the orchard, armed with a rake, brush
scythe, and axe, and located the spot on the stone wall
which exactly faced my front door. I marked it with
a stake, and thinned out the ash-leaved maples which
grew like a fringe between the wall and the brook, so
that the best ones could spread into more attractive
trees, and so that a semicircular space was also cleared
which could surround the pool, as it were, and in which
I could place a bench, up against the foliage, to face
the door of the house. From the door you would look
over the pool to the bench. From the bench you would
look over the pool and up the slope through the orchard
to the house entrance. After I had the bench site
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
correctly located, I saw that the four flower beds which
Miss Goodwin and I had made were at least four feet
out of centre, and would all have to be moved. But
that was too much of a task for my present mood. I
left them as they were, and busied myself with rooting
out undeniable weeds and carting off the slash and
rubbish.</p>

<p>My mind was not on the task. Over and over I was
asking myself the question, &#8220;Do I love her? What
permanence is there in a spring passion, amid gardens
and thrush songs, for a girl who caresses the sympathies
by her na√Øve delight in the novelty of country
life? How much of my feeling for her <i>is</i> passion, and
how much is sympathy, even pity?&#8221;</p>

<p>Over and over I turned these questions, while my
hands worked mechanically. And over and over, too,
I will be honest and admit, the selfish incrustations
of bachelor habits imposed their opposition to the
thought of union. I had bought the farm to be my
own lord and master; here I was to work, to create
masterpieces of literature, to plan gardens, to play
golf, to smoke all over the house, to toil all night and
sleep all day if I so desired, to wear soft shirts and never
dress for dinner, to maintain my own habits, my own
individuality, undisturbed. What had been so pleasant,
so tinglingly pleasant, for a day, a week&#8211;the presence
of the girl in the garden, in the house, the rustle of
her skirt, the sound of her fingers on the keys&#8211;would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
it be always pleasant? What if one wished to escape
from it, and there were no escape? Passions pall; life,
work, ambitions, the need of solitude for creation, the
individual soul, go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of which means,&#8221; I thought, laying down my
brush scythe and gazing into the brook, &#8220;that I am not
sure of myself. And if I am not sure of myself, do I
really love her? And if I am not sure of that, I must
wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>That resolution, the first definite thing my mind had
laid hold on, came to me as the sun was sinking toward
the west. I went to the house, changed my clothes,
and hastened up the road to meet her, curiously eager
for a man in doubt.</p>

<p>She was coming out of the door as I crossed the bit of
lawn, dressed not in the working clothes which she
had worn on our gardening days, but all in white, with
a lavender ribbon at her throat. She smiled at me
brightly and ran down the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to New York&#8211;but see Twin Fires first,&#8221; she
laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m all ready for the tour.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had not quite expected so much lightness of heart
from her, and I was a little piqued, perhaps, as I answered,
&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem very sorry that you are seeing
it for the last time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled into my face. &#8220;All pleasant things have
to end,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so why be glum about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they have to end?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>&#8220;In my experience, always,&#8221; she nodded.</p>

<p>I was silent. My resolution, which I confess had
wavered a little when she came through the doorway,
was fixed again. Just the light banter in her tone had
done it. We walked down the road, and went first
around the house to take a look at the lawn and rose
trellis. The young grass was already a frail green
from the house to the roses, the flowers around the
white sundial pedestal, while not yet in bloom, showed
a mass of low foliage, the nasturtiums were already
trying to cling, with the aid of strings, to the bird bath
(which I had forgotten to fill), and the rose trellis,
coloured green by the painters before they departed,
was even now hidden slightly at the base by the vines
of the new roses.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said I, pointing to it, &#8220;is the child of your
brain, your aqueduct of roses, which you refuse to see
in blossom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The child of my hands, too; don&#8217;t forget that!&#8221; she
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of <i>our</i> hands,&#8221; I corrected.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ghost of Rome in roses,&#8221; she said, half to herself.
&#8220;It will be very lovely another year, when the
vines have covered it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it will be then, I trust,&#8221; said I, &#8220;rather less like
&#8217;the rose of beauty on the brow of chaos.&#8217; The lawn
will look like a lawn by then, and possibly I shall have
achieved a sundial plate.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>&#8220;Possibly you will,&#8221; said she, with a suspicious
twinkle. &#8220;And possibly you&#8217;ll have remembered to
fill your bird bath.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned abruptly into the house and emerged with
a pitcher of water, tiptoeing over the frail, new grass
to the bath, which she filled to the brim, pouring the
remainder upon the vines at the base.</p>

<p>&#8220;My last activity shall be for the birds,&#8221; she smiled, as
she came back with the pitcher. As if in gratitude, a
bird came winging out of the orchard behind her, and
dipped his breast and bill in the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;The darling!&#8221; I heard her exclaim, under her breath.</p>

<p>We took the pitcher inside, and I saw her glance at
the flowers in the vases. &#8220;I ought to get you some
fresh ones,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Those shall stay a long while,
in memory of the good fairy. Now I will show you my
house. You have never seen my house above the first
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t proper,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be even
here, in the south room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have been here many times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she laughed. &#8220;Stupid! But Mrs. Pillig wasn&#8217;t
here then!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said I, a light dawning on my masculine
stupidity, &#8220;I begin to realize the paradoxes of propriety.
And now I see at last why I shouldn&#8217;t have asked you
to pick the paint for the dining-room&#8211;when I did.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>Her eyes narrowed, and she looked into my face with
sudden gravity. &#8220;I wonder if you do understand?&#8221;
she answered. Slowly a half-wistful smile crept into
the corners of her mouth, and she shook her head.
&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t; you don&#8217;t at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then her old laugh came bubbling up. &#8220;I suspect
Mrs. Pillig is more of an authority on pies than propriety,&#8221;
she said in a cautious voice, &#8220;and, besides, I&#8217;m
going away to-morrow, and, besides, I don&#8217;t care anyway.
Lead on.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went up the uncarpeted front stairs, into the
square upper hall which was lighted by an east window
over the front door. I showed her first the spare room
on the northeast corner, which connected with the bath,
and then the second front chamber opposite, which was
not yet furnished even with a bed. Then we entered
my chamber, where the western sun was streaming in.
She stood in the door a second, looking about, and then
advanced and surveyed the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bedclothes aren&#8217;t tucked in right,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; I answered sadly. &#8220;I have to fix
them myself every night. Mrs. Pillig is better on
pies.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl leaned over and remade my monastic white
cot, giving the pillow a final pat to smooth it. Then
she inspected the shingles and old photographs on the
walls, turning from an undergraduate picture of me, in
a group, to scan my face, and shaking her head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me I&#8217;m
getting bald.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not bald,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but your eyes don&#8217;t
see visions as they did then.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at her, startled a little. &#8220;What makes you
say that?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; she replied quickly. &#8220;I meant
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You meant what you said,&#8221; I answered, moving
close to her, &#8220;and it is true. It is true of all men, and
all women, in a way&#8211;of all save the chosen few who
are the poets and seers. &#8217;Shades of the prison house
begin to close&#8217;&#8211;you know that shadow, too, I guess. I
have no picture of you when you were younger. No&#8211;you
are still the poet; you see aqueducts of roses. So
you think I&#8217;m prosy now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that,&#8221; she answered, very low.</p>

<p>&#8220;One vision I&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;one vision,
lately. It was&#8211;it was<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>I broke abruptly off, remembering suddenly my
resolve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll show you Mrs. Pillig&#8217;s
quarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>She followed in silence, and peeped with me into the
chambers in the ell, smiling a little as she saw Peter&#8217;s
clothes scattered on the floor and bed. Then, still in
silence, and with the golden light of afternoon streaming
across the slopes of my farm, we entered the pines by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
woodshed, and followed the new path along by the
potato field and the pasture wall, pausing here and
there to gather the first wild rose buds, and turning
down through the cloister at the south.</p>

<p>As we slipped into the corner of the tamarack swamp
my heart was beating high, my pulses racing with the
recollection of all the tense moments in that grove
ahead, since first I met her there. I know not with
what feelings she entered. It was plain now even to
me that she was masking them in a mood of lightness.
She danced ahead over the new plank walk, and laughed
back at me over her shoulder as she disappeared into
the pines. A second later I found her sitting on the
stone I had placed by the pool.</p>

<p>She looked up out of the corners of her eyes. &#8220;I
should think this would be a good place to wade,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it might,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Do you want to try it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to run along to the turn by the road
and wait?&#8221; The eyes still mocked me.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly. &#8220;And I did so want to
wade,&#8221; she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, yes. I won&#8217;t have a chance again for&#8211;oh,
never, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then of course I&#8217;ll go ahead.&#8221; I stepped over the
brook, out of sight. A moment later I heard a soft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
splashing of the water, and a voice called, &#8220;I&#8217;m only six
now. Oh, it&#8217;s such fun&#8211;and so cold!&#8221;</p>

<p>I made no reply. In fancy I could see her white feet
in the water, her face tipped up in the shadows, her eyes
large with delight. How sweet she was, how desirable!
I stood lost in a rosy reverie, when suddenly I felt her
beside me, and turned to meet her smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;How you like the brook,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;How I love it!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think me
silly, but it really says secret things to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such secrets as the stream told to Rossetti?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She looked away. &#8220;I said secret things,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>We moved on, around the bend by the road where
the little picture of far hills came into view, and back
into the dusk of the thickest pines. At the second
crossing of the brook, I took her hand to steady her
over the slippery stones, and when we were across, the
mood and memories of the place had their way with us,
and our hands did not unclasp. We walked on so together
to the spot where we first had met, and where
first the thrush had sounded for us his elfin clarion.
There we stopped and listened, but there was no sound
save the whisper of the pines.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pines sound like soft midnight surf on the
shore,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want the thrush,&#8221; I whispered back. &#8220;I want
the thrush!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, raising her eyes to mine, &#8220;oh, yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, as we waited, our eyes meeting, suddenly
he sang, far off across the tamaracks, one perfect call,
and silence again. Her face was a glimmering radiance
in the dusk. Her hand was warm in mine. Slowly my
face sank toward hers, and our lips met&#8211;met for an
instant when we were not masters of ourselves, when
the bird song and the whispering pines wrought their
pagan spell upon us.</p>

<p>Another instant, and she stood away from me, one
hand over her mouth, one hand on her panting breast,
and fright in her eyes. Then, as suddenly, she laughed.
It was hardly a nervous laugh. It welled up with the
familiar gurgle from her throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Upton,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are a bad man. That
wasn&#8217;t what the thrush said at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I misunderstood,&#8221; said I, recovering more slowly,
and astounded by her mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not reproach you, since I, a philologist, misunderstood
for a second myself,&#8221; she responded. &#8220;Hark!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sudden sound of steps and crackling
twigs in the grove behind us, and Buster emerged up
the path, hot on our scent. He made a dab with his
tongue at my hand, and then fell upon Miss Goodwin.
She sank to her knees and began to caress him, very
quickly, so that I could not see her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stella,&#8221; said I, &#8220;Buster has made a friend of you.
That&#8217;s always a great compliment from a dog.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>She kept her face buried in his neck an instant longer,
and then her eyes lifted to mine. &#8220;Yes&#8211;John,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;And now I must go home to pack my trunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me drive you to the station in the morning,&#8221;
said I, as we emerged from the grove, in this sudden
strange, calm intimacy, when no word had been spoken,
and I, at least, was quite in the dark as to her feelings.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No, I go too early for you.
You&#8211;you mustn&#8217;t try to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>For just a second her voice wavered. She stopped
for a last look at Twin Fires. &#8220;Nice house, nice garden,
nice brook,&#8221; she said, and added, with a little smile,
&#8220;nice rose trellis.&#8221; Then we walked up the road, and
at Bert&#8217;s door she put out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>Her eyes looked frankly into mine. There was nothing
there but smiling friendship. The fingers did not
tremble in my grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall write,&#8221; said I, controlling my voice with
difficulty, &#8220;and send you pictures of the garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was gone. I walked slowly back to my dwelling.
I had kept my resolution. Yet how strangely I had
kept it! What did it mean? Had I been strong? No.
Had she made me keep it? Who could say? All had
been so sudden&#8211;the kiss, her springing away, her
abrupt, astonishing laughter. But she had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
reproached me, she had not been righteously angry, nor,
still less, absurd. She had thought it, perhaps, but the
mood of the place and hour, and understood. That
was fine, generous! Few women, I thought, would be
capable of it. Stella! How pleasant it had been to
say the name! Then the memory of her kiss came over
me like a wave, and my supper stood neglected, and all
that evening I sat staring idly at my manuscripts and
stroking Buster&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>Yes, I had kept my resolution&#8211;and felt like a fool,
a happy, hopeless fool!</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span><a id='link_16'></a>Chapter XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>I GO TO NEW YORK FOR A PURPOSE</span></h2>

<p>I shall not here recount the events on the farm
during the weeks which followed Miss Stella&#8217;s departure.
They did not particularly interest me. My whole
psychological make-up had been violently shaken, the
centres of attention had been shifted, and I was constantly
struggling for a readjustment which did not come.
The post-office appealed to me more than the peas, and I
laboured harder over my photographs of the sundial beds
than over the beds themselves. I sent for a ray filter
and a wide-angle lens, spending hours in experiment
and covering a plank in front of the south door with
printing frames.</p>

<p>I had written to her the day after she had departed,
but no reply came for a week, and then only a brief
little note, telling me it was hot in town and conveying
her regards to the roses. I, too, waited a week&#8211;though
it was hard&#8211;and then answered, sending some
photographs, one of them a snapshot of a bird on the
edge of the bath, one of them of Buster sitting on his
hind legs. Again she answered briefly, merrily,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
conveying her especial regards to Buster, but ending with a
plaintive little postscript about the heat.</p>

<p>I sat, the evening after this letter arrived, in my big,
cool room, with Buster beside me, and thought of her
down there in the swelter of town. I wanted to answer
her letter, and wanted to answer it tenderly. I was
lonely in my great, cool room; I was unspeakably lonely.</p>

<p>Suddenly it occurred to me that this was the evening
of Class Day. The Yard was full of lanterns, of music,
of shimmering dresses, of pretty faces, of young men in
mortar boards and gowns. I might have been sitting
in the deep window recess of my old room above the
Yard, drinking in the scene with the pleasant impersonal
wistfulness of an older man in the presence of happy
youth. But I wasn&#8217;t. I was sitting here alone with
Buster, thinking of a poor girl in a hot, lonely New York
lodging-house. I pulled my pad toward me and wrote
her a letter. It read:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>Dear, Nice Lady: I&#8217;m lying here on the rug, my tail
quite tired after a hard day&#8217;s work, looking up in Mr.
John&#8217;s face. His face is kind of glum and his eyes sort of
faraway looking. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the matter with
him. He&#8217;s been that way nights for two or three weeks
now, which makes me sad, too; only he goes to the
post-office often, which makes me glad, &#8217;cause I love to
walk or to run behind the buggy, and there&#8217;s a collie pup
on the way who is very nice. What do you suppose is
the trouble? Sometimes he goes to the brook and sits
on a stone by a pool there, while I go wading and get
my stummick wet and drippy and cool. I wish you&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>come back. I didn&#8217;t get to know you so awful well,
but I liked you, and a house with just one glum, stupid
man in it ain&#8217;t&#8211;I mean isn&#8217;t&#8211;very nice, &#8217;specially
as Peter&#8217;s still at school. Schools last awful late up
here.</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p class='btar'>I am yours waggishly&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Buster,&#8221; said I. The pup rose and snuggled
his nose into my lap. I picked him up, held his forepaw
firmly and put some ink on it with the end of a
match. Then I held the paper below it, pressed the
paw down, and made a signature, wiping the paw afterward
with a blotter. Buster enjoyed the strange operation,
and wagged his tail furiously. I sealed and addressed
the letter, and went to bed.</p>

<p>A few days later a box came addressed to Buster in
my care. I opened it in Buster&#8217;s presence, indeed
literally beneath his nose. On top was a small package,
tied with blue ribbon, and labelled &#8220;For Buster.&#8221;
It proved to be a dog biscuit, which the recipient at
once took to the hearth and began upon. Beneath
this was a note, which I opened with eager fingers.
It began:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p><span class='sc'>Darling Buster</span>: Your waggish epistle received
and contents noted. While most of us at times agree
with him who said that the more he saw of men the
better he liked dogs, nevertheless the canine intelligence
is in some ways limited. Pray do not misunderstand
me, dear Buster. In its limits lies its loyalty!
No man is a hero to his valet, but every man to his
dog. However, these same limits of the canine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>intelligence, which logic compels me to assume that you also
possess, are probably responsible for your mistake in
assigning the term glumness to what you observe in
Master John, when it is really lack of occupation. You
see, dear Buster, he has got Twin Fires so far under
way that he doesn&#8217;t work at it all the time, so he ought
to be at his writing of stories, made up of big dictionary
words which I am defining or inventing for him down
here in a very hot, dirty, dusty, smelly town. He isn&#8217;t
doing that, is he? Won&#8217;t you please tell him to?
Tell him that&#8217;s all the trouble. He has a reaction from
his first farming enthusiasm, and doesn&#8217;t realize that
the thing to do is to go to work on the new line, <i>his</i>
line. For it <i>is</i> his line, you know, Buster.</p>

<p>Underneath this you&#8217;ll find something to give him,
with my best wishes for sunshine on the dear garden.
I&#8217;d kiss you, Buster, only dogs are terribly germy.</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p class='btar'>Stella.</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>P.S. That <i>is</i> a nice pool, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>I sat on the floor with the letter in my lap, smiling
happily over it. Then I took the last package out of
the box. It was heavy, evidently metal. Removing
the papers, I held in my hand an old bronze sundial
plate, a round one to fit my column, and upon it,
freshly engraved, the ancient motto&#8211;</p>

<div style='text-align:center; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;'>
<img src='images/illus-302.jpg' alt='' />
</div>

<p>My first thought was of its cost. She couldn&#8217;t afford
it, the silly, generous girl! She&#8217;d bought it, doubtless,
at one of those expensive New York antique shops,
and then taken it to an engraver&#8217;s, for further expense.
I ought not accept it. Yet how could I refuse? I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
couldn&#8217;t. I hugged it to my heart, and fairly ran to
the dial post, Buster at my heels. It was already
nearly noon, so I set it on the pedestal, got a level and
a pot of glue, which was the only means of securing it
to the post which I had, and watch in hand waited for
the minute of twelve. At the minute, I set the shadow
between the noon lines, levelled it with thin bits of
match underneath, and glued it down. Then I stood
off and surveyed it, sitting there in the sun&#8211;<i>her</i> dial!
Then I ran for my camera.</p>

<p>I developed the film at once, and made a print that
afternoon. When it was made, I went out into the
vegetable garden, on a sudden impulse to work off
physical energy, took the wheel hoe away from Mike,
and began to cultivate.</p>

<p>Did you ever spend an afternoon with a wheel hoe,
up and down, up and down, between rows of beets
and carrots and onions, between cauliflower plants and
tomato vines, between pepper plants and lettuce? It
requires a certain fixity of attention to keep the weeders
or the cultivator teeth close to the plants without also
injuring them. But there is a soothing monotony in
the forward pushes of the machine, and a profound satisfaction
in seeing the weeds come up, the ground grow
clean and brown and broken on each side of the row
behind you, and to feel, too, how much you are accomplishing
with the aid of this comparatively simple
tool.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>My early peas were ready for market. Mike announced
that he was going to take the first lot over in
the morning. They had been planted very late, but
fortune had favoured them, and now they were hardly
more than a week behind Bert&#8217;s, which had been
planted early in April. The foot-high corn was waving
in the breeze, the long rows of delicate onion tops,
of beets, carrots, radishes, and lettuce plants were as
characteristically different as the vegetables themselves.
I fixed their characteristics in my vision. I suddenly
found myself taking a renewed interest in the farm. As
I paused to wipe my bronzed forehead or relight my
pipe, I would raise my head and look back over the
rows, or through the trellis aqueduct to the house, seeing
the sundial telling the hours on the lawn, and think
of Stella, think of her down in the hot city, where I
knew at last that I should not let her stay.</p>

<p>Yes, I had no longer any doubts. I wanted her. I
should always want her. Twin Fires was incomplete,
I was incomplete, life was incomplete, without her.
I pushed the hoe with redoubled zeal, long after Mike
had milked the cows and departed.</p>

<p>At six I stopped, amazed to find the plot of a story
in my head. Heaven knows how it got there, but there
it was, almost as full-statured as Minerva when she
sprang from the head of Jove, though considerably less
glacial. I even had the opening sentence all ready
framed&#8211;to me always the most difficult point of story
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
or essay, except the closing sentence. Nor did this
tale appear to be one I had incubated in the past, and
which now popped up above the &#8220;threshold&#8221; from my
subconsciousness. It was a brand-new plot, a perfect
stranger to me. The phenomenon interested me almost
as much as the plot. The tale grew even clearer as I
took my bath, and haunted me during supper, so that
I was peremptory in my replies to poor Mrs. Pillig and
refused to aid Peter that evening with his geography.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; said I, vaguely, going into my study
and locking the door.</p>

<p>I worked all that evening, got up at midnight to
forage for a glass of milk and a fresh supply of oil for
my lamp, and returned to my desk to work till four,
when the sun astonished me. The story was done!
Instead of going to bed, I went down in the cool of
the young morning, when only the birds were astir,
and took my bath in Stella&#8217;s pool. Then I went to the
dew-drenched pea vines and began to pick peas.</p>

<p>Here Mike found me, with nearly half a bushel
gathered, when he appeared early to pick for market.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the early bird gets the peas,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is shurely,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;You might say you
had a tiliphone call to get up&#8211;only these ain&#8217;t tiliphones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike!&#8221; I cried, &#8220;a pun before breakfast!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure, I&#8217;ve had me breakfast,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Which reminded me that I hadn&#8217;t. I went in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
house to get it, reading over and correcting my manuscript
as I ate. After breakfast I put on respectable
clothes, tucked the manuscript in my pocket, and
mounted the seat of my farm wagon, beside Mike. Behind
us were almost two bushels of peas and several
bunches of tall, juicy, red rhubarb stalks from the old
hills we found on the place. Mike had greatly enriched
the soil, and grown the plants in barrels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a real farmer now,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye are, shurely,&#8221; Mike replied. &#8220;Them&#8217;s good
peas, if they was planted late.&#8221;</p>

<p>We drove past the golf links and the summer hotel, to
the market, where I was already known, I found, and
greeted by name as I entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll buy anything you&#8217;ll sell me,&#8221; said the proprietor,
&#8220;and be glad to get it. Funny thing about this
town, the way folks won&#8217;t take the trouble to sell what
they raise. Most of the big summer estates have their
own gardens, of course, but there&#8217;s nearly a hundred
families that don&#8217;t, and four boarding-houses, and the
hotels. Why, the hotels send to New York for vegetables&#8211;if
you can beat that! Guess all our farmers
with any gumption have gone to the cities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;m not in farming for my health,
which has always been good. I&#8217;ve got more than a
bushel of peas out there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Peas!&#8221; cried the market man. &#8220;Why, I have more
demands for peas than I can fill. The folks who could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
sell me peas won&#8217;t plant &#8217;em &#8217;cause it&#8217;s too much trouble
or expense to provide the brush. I&#8217;ll give you eight cents
a quart for peas to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is too easy,&#8221; I whispered to Mike, as we went
out to get the baskets.</p>

<p>I sold my rhubarb also, and came away with a little
book in which there was entered to my credit $4.16
for peas and $1.66 for rhubarb. I put the book proudly
in my pocket, for it represented my first earnings from
the farm, and mounting the farm wagon again told
Mike to drive me to the hotel.</p>

<p>As we pulled up before the veranda, the line of old
ladies in rockers focussed their eyes upon us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure,&#8221; whispered Mike, &#8220;they look like they was
hung out to dry!&#8221;</p>

<p>I went up the steps and into the office, where the
hotel proprietor suavely greeted me, asked after my
health, and inquired how my &#8220;estate&#8221; was getting on.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean my farm,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>He smiled politely, but not without a skepticism which
annoyed me. I hastened from him, and left my manuscript
with the stenographer, who had arrived for the
summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call for the copy to-morrow noon,&#8221; said I. Then
I went to the telegraph booth and sent a day letter to
Stella. &#8220;Buster sending me to thank you,&#8221; it read.
&#8220;Meet me Hotel Belmont six to-morrow. Sold over a
bushel of peas to-day. Prepare to celebrate.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>&#8220;Mike,&#8221; said I, returning to the cart, &#8220;drop me at
the golf club. Tell Mrs. Pillig not to expect me to
lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was ten o&#8217;clock when we arrived at the entrance to
the club. I jumped out and Mike drove on. The
professional took my name, and promised to hand it
to the proper authorities as a candidate. Then I paid
the fee for the day, borrowed some clubs from him, and
we set out. I had not touched a club since the winter
set in. How good the driver felt in my hand! How
sweetly the ball flew from the club (as the golf ball
advertisements phrase it), on the first attempt! I
sprang down the course in pursuit, elated to see that I
had driven even with the pro. Alas! my second was not
like unto it! His second spun neatly up on the green and
came to rest. Mine went off my mashie like a cannon
ball, and overshot into the road. My third went ten
feet. But it was glorious. Why shouldn&#8217;t a farmer
play golf? Why shouldn&#8217;t a golfer run a farm? Why
shouldn&#8217;t either write stories? Heavens, what a lot of
pleasant things there are to do in the world, I thought to
myself, as I finally reached the green and sank my putt.
Poor Stella, sweltering over a dictionary in New York!
Soon she&#8217;d be here, too. She should learn to play golf,
she should dig flower beds, she should wade in a brook.
I flubbed my second drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking your eye off,&#8221; said the pro.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m taking my mind off,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Give me a stroke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
a hole from here, for double the price of the round, or
quits?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>I stung him, too! I felt so elated that I went back to
the hotel for an elaborate luncheon, and returned for
eighteen holes more. The feats a man can perform the
first day after he has had no sleep are astonishing. The
second day it is different. In fact, I began to get groggy
about the tenth hole that afternoon, so that the pro.
got back his losses, as in a burst of bravado I had offered
to double the morning bet. He came back with an unholy
68 that afternoon, confound him! They always do
when the bet is big enough, which is really why they are
called professionals.</p>

<p>That night I slept ten hours, worked over my manuscripts
most of the next morning, packed a load of
them in my suitcase, and after an early dinner got
Peter to drive me to the train, for his school had now
closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter,&#8221; said I at the station, &#8220;your job is to take
care of your mother, and keep the kindlings split, and
drive to market for Mike when he needs you. Also to
water the lawn and flower beds with the spray nozzle
every morning. Mind, now, the spray nozzle! If I
find you&#8217;ve used the heavy stream, I&#8217;ll&#8211;I&#8217;ll&#8211;I&#8217;ll sell
Buster!&#8221;</p>

<p>That amiable creature tried to climb aboard the train
with me, and Peter had to haul him off by the tail. My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
last sight of Bentford was a yellow dog squirming and
barking in a small boy&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>The train was hot and stuffy. It grew hotter and
stuffier as we came out of the mountains into the
Connecticut lowlands, and we were all sweltering in
the Pullman by the time New York was reached. As I
stepped out of the Grand Central station into Forty-second
Street my ears were assaulted by the unaccustomed
din, my nose by the pungent odour of city
streets, my eyes smarted in a dust whirl. But my heart
was pounding with joy and expectation as I hurried
across the street.</p>

<p>I climbed the broad steps to the lobby of the hotel,
and scarcely had my feet reached the top than I saw a
familiar figure rise from a chair. I ran toward her,
waving off the boy who rushed to grab my bag. A
second later her hand was in mine, her eyes upon my
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8211;it was nice of Buster to send you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look so white, so tired,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Where
is all your tan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Melted,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;Have you business in
town? It&#8217;s awfully hot here, you poor man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I have business here, very important
business. But first some supper and a spree. I&#8217;ve got
&#8217;most two bushels of peas to spend!&#8221;</p>

<p>We had a gay supper, and then took a cab, left my
grip at my college club, where I had long maintained a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
non-resident membership, and drove thence to Broadway.</p>

<p>&#8220;How like Bentford Main Street!&#8221; I laughed, as we
emerged from Fourty-fourth Street into the blaze of
grotesque electric signs which have a kind of bizarre
beauty, none the less. &#8220;Where shall we go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a revival of &#8217;Patience&#8217; at the Casino,&#8221; she
suggested, &#8220;and there are the Ziegfeld Follies<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the Follies,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m neither a
drummer nor a rural Sunday-school superintendent.
Gilbert and Sullivan sounds good, and I&#8217;ve never heard
&#8217;Patience.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>We found our places in the Casino just as the curtain
was going up, and I saw &#8220;Patience&#8221; for the first time.
I was glad it was for the first time, because she was with
me, to share my delight. As incomparable tune after
tune floated out to us the absurdest of absurd words,
her eyes twinkled into mine, and our shoulders leaned
together, and finally, between the seats, I squeezed her
fingers with unrestrainable delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice Gilbert and Sullivan,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a masterpiece; it&#8217;s a masterpiece!&#8221; I whispered
back. &#8220;It&#8217;s as perfect in its way as&#8211;as your sundial!
Oh, I&#8217;m so glad you are with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it worth coming way to New York for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Under the conditions, around the world for,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>She coloured rosy, and looked back at the stage.</p>

<p>After the performance she would not let me get a cab.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve not that many peas on the place,&#8221; she said.
So we walked downtown to her lodgings, through the
hot, dusty, half-deserted streets, into the older section
of the city below Fourteenth Street. I said little, save
to answer her volley of eager questions about the farm.
At the steps of an ancient house near Washington Square
she paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is where I live,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a lovely
evening. Shall I see you again before you go back?&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled, took the latchkey from her hand, opened
the door, and stepped behind her, to her evident surprise,
into the large, silent, musty-smelling hall. She darted
a quick look about, but I ignored it, taking her hand and
leading her quickly into the parlour, where, by the faint
light from the hall, I could see an array of mid-Victorian
plush. The house was silent. Still holding her hand,
I drew her to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going back&#8211;alone,&#8221; I whispered. &#8220;You
are going with me. Stella, I cannot live without you.
Twin Fires is crying for its mistress. You are going
back, too, away from the heat and dust and the town,
into a house where the sweet air wanders, into the pines
where the hermit sings and the pool is thirsty for your
feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard in the stillness a strange sob, and suddenly her
head was on my breast and her tears were flowing. My
arms closed about her.</p>

<p>Presently she lifted her face, and our lips met. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
put up her hands and held my face within them. &#8220;So
that was what the thrush said, after all,&#8221; she whispered,
with a hint of a happy smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;To me, yes,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t dream it was to you.
<i>Was</i> it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you&#8217;ll never know,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;and you&#8217;ll
always be too stupid to guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stupid! You called me that once before about the
painters. Why were you angry about choosing the
dining-room paint?&#8221;</p>

<p>She grew suddenly wistful. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you that,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;It was&#8211;it was because you let a third person
into our little drama of Twin Fires. I&#8211;I was a fool,
maybe. But I was playing out a kind&#8211;a kind of dream
of home building. Two can play such a dream, if they
don&#8217;t speak of it. But not three. Then it becomes&#8211;it
becomes, well, matter-of-facty, and people talk, and
the bloom goes, and&#8211;you hurt me a little, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not reply for a moment. What man can
before the wistful sweetness of a woman&#8217;s secret moods?
I could only kiss her hair. Finally words came. &#8220;The
dream shall be reality now,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and you and I
together will make Twin Fires the loveliest spot in all
the hills. To-morrow we&#8217;ll buy a stair carpet, and&#8211;lots
of things&#8211;together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still with the pea money?&#8221; she gurgled, her gayety
coming back. &#8220;No, sir; I&#8217;ve some money, too. Not
much, but a little to take the place of the wedding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
presents I&#8217;ve no relatives to give me. I want to help
furnish Twin Fires.&#8221; She laid her fingers on my protesting
lips. &#8220;I shall, anyway,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We are
two lone orphans, you and I, but we have each other, and
all that is mine is yours, all&#8211;all&#8211;all!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly she threw her arms about my neck, and I
was silent in the mystery of her passion.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span><a id='link_17'></a>Chapter XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>I DO NOT RETURN ALONE</span></h2>

<p>Many people, I presume, long to fly from New York
during a late June and early July hot spell. But nobody
who does not possess a new place in the country,
still unfurnished, with a garden crying for his attention
and a brook wandering amid the pines, can possibly
realize how the dust and heat of town affected me in the
next ten days. It affected me the more because I saw
how pale Stella was, how tired when the evenings came.
With her woman&#8217;s conscientiousness, she was struggling
to do two weeks&#8217; work in one before leaving the dictionary.
She even toiled several evenings, denying
herself to me, while I wandered disconsolate along
Broadway, or worked over my manuscripts at the club,
surrounded by siphons of soda. At the luncheon hour
and between five and six we shopped madly, getting a
stair carpet, dining-room chairs (a present from her to
herself and me, as she put it&#8211;fine Chippendale reproductions),
a few rugs&#8211;as many as we could afford&#8211;and
other necessary furnishings, including stuff for
curtains. For the south room the curtains were gay
Japanese silk from an Oriental store, to balance the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
Hiroshiges, and while we were buying them she slipped
away from me and presently returned, the proud possessor
of two small ivory elephants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, somebody has sent us another present!&#8221; she
laughed. &#8220;Folks are so good to us! These are to
stand on the twin mantels, under the prints.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From whom are they?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your best friend and my worst enemy,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>For three days after she left the office of the dictionary
I saw little of her. &#8220;There are some things you
can&#8217;t buy for me&#8211;or with me,&#8221; she smiled. Then
we went down together to the City Hall for our
license, sneaking in after hours, thanks to the kindly
offices of a classmate of mine, the city editor of a newspaper.
The clerk beamed upon us like a municipal
Cupid.</p>

<p>That last evening she left me, to pack her trunks, and
I went back to the club, and found there a letter from
the magazine where I had submitted my story. It was
a letter of acceptance! Misfortunes are not the only
things which never come singly. I danced for joy.
If the stores had been open I should have rushed out
then and there and bought the mahogany secretary we
had seen a few days before and wistfully passed by.
Fortunately, they were not open.</p>

<p>In the morning my cab stopped in front of the old
house near Washington Square, and Stella came forth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
with a friend, a sober little person who appeared greatly
impressed with her responsibilities, and bore the totally
inappropriate name of Marguerite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, dear!&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never attended a bride
before. It&#8217;s very trying. And it&#8217;s very mean of you,
Mr. Upton, to take Stella from us, and leave me with a
new and stupid co-worker. How do you expect the
dictionary to come out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said I, &#8220;nor do I care if it doesn&#8217;t. There
are too many words in the world already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill Chadwick, another classmate of mine, came up
from downtown, and met us at the church door. The
rector was a friend and fellow alumnus of ours. It was
like a tiny family party, suddenly and solemnly hushed
by the organ as we stood before the altar, and in the
warm dimness of the great vacant church Stella and I
were made man and wife. The four of us went out to
the cab again, and Bill insisted on a wedding breakfast
at Sherry&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he said, &#8220;you two gumshoe into an
engagement, and get married without so much as a reporter
in the church, and then expect to make a getaway
like a pair of safe breakers! No, sir, you come with
me, and get one real civilized meal before you go back
to your farm fodder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill had the solemn little bridesmaid laughing before
the luncheon was over, but the last we saw of them they
were waving us good-bye from behind the grating as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
we went down the platform to our train, and the poor
girl was mopping her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t the best man supposed to fall in love with the
bridesmaid?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;At least I hope he&#8217;ll dry her
tears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious, yes!&#8221; cried Stella. &#8220;I never thought
of that. You don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;ve done! Marguerite
is a dear girl and an excellent cross-indexer, but she&#8217;s no
wife for your gay friend William. You&#8217;d best send him
a telegram of warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; said I. &#8220;Bill has cruised so long in Petticoat
Bay as a blockade runner that I hope she shoots
him full of holes and boards him in triumph. Besides,
<i>everybody</i> ought to get married.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stella&#8217;s eyes looked up at mine, deep and happy below
their twinkle, and we boarded the train.</p>

<p>The train started, it left New York behind, it ran
into the suburbs, then into the country, and at last
the hills began to mount beside the track, and a cooler,
fresher air to come in through the windows. Still her
eyes smiled into mine, but she said little, save now and
then to lean forward and whisper, &#8220;Is it true, John, is
it true?&#8221;</p>

<p>So we came to Bentford station, in the early dusk of
evening, and the air was good as we alighted, and the
silence. Suddenly Buster appeared, undulating with
joyous yelps along the platform, and sprang at Stella&#8217;s
face. He almost ignored me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>Peter was waiting with the buggy. We sat him between
us and drove home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Home&#8211;your home, our home,&#8221; I whispered, pressing
her hand behind Peter&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sold a lot o&#8217; peas and things,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;I got
&#8217;em all down in the book. Gee, I drove over &#8217;most
every day, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to be on the ball team in the
village, an&#8217; I wanter join the Boy Scouts, but ma won&#8217;t
let me &#8217;less you say it&#8217;s all right, an&#8217; ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll think it over, Peter,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Stella was bouncing up and down on the seat with excitement
as the buggy rattled over the bridge. Lamplight
was streaming from Twin Fires. On the kitchen
porch stood Mrs. Pillig, dressed in her best, and Mrs.
Bert and Bert. As we climbed from the buggy, Bert
raised his hand, and a shower of rice descended upon us.
Stella ran up the path, and Mrs. Bert&#8217;s ample arms
closed about her. Both women were half laughing,
half crying, when I got there with the grips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that jest like the sex?&#8221; said Bert, with a jerk
of his thumb&#8211;&#8220;so durn glad they gotter cry about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shet up,&#8221; said Mrs. Bert. &#8220;For all <i>you</i> know,
I&#8217;m pityin&#8217; the poor child!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pillig had an ample dinner ready for us, with
vegetables and salad fresh from the garden, and, as a
crowning glory, a magnificent lemon pie.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is much better than anything at Sherry&#8217;s,&#8221;
cried Stella, beaming upon her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>We sat a long while looking at each other across the
small table, and then we wandered out into the dewy
evening and our feet took us into the pines, where in
the darkness we stopped by a now sacred spot and held
each other close in silence. Then we went back into
the south room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if the curtain stuff would only hurry up and
come!&#8221; cried my wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must learn patience&#8211;Mrs. Upton,&#8221; said I,
while we both laughed sillily over the title, as others
have done before us, no doubt. Presently Mrs. Pillig&#8217;s
anxious face appeared at the door. She seemed desirous
of speaking, and doubtful how to begin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Mrs. Pillig?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; she said, hesitantly, &#8220;I suppose now you
are married you won&#8217;t need me, after all.&#8221; She paused.
&#8220;I rented my house,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Need you!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Why now I shall need you
more than ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled faintly, still looking dubious. Stella went
over to her. &#8220;What he means is, that I&#8217;m a poor goose
who doesn&#8217;t know any more about keeping house than
Buster does about astronomy,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;Of course
you&#8217;ll stay, Mrs. Pillig, and teach me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss&#8211;I mean Missus,&#8221; said Mrs.
Pillig, backing out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful,&#8221; I warned. &#8220;If you let Mrs. Pillig
think you&#8217;re so very green, she&#8217;ll begin to boss you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>&#8220;That <i>would</i> be a new sensation,&#8221; laughed Stella.
&#8220;I like new sensations as much as Peter Pan did. Oh,
it&#8217;s a new sensation having a home like this, and living
in the country, and smelling good, cool air and&#8211;and
having <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was suddenly beside me on the settle. We heard
Mrs. Pillig going up to bed. The house was still.
Outside the choral song of night insects sounded drowsily.
Buster came softly in and plopped down on the
rug. We were alone in Twin Fires, together, and she
would not rise to go up the road to Bert&#8217;s. She would
never go! So we sat a long, long while&#8211;and the rest
shall be silence.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span><a id='link_18'></a>Chapter XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>WE BUILD A POOL</span></h2>

<p>It was the strangest, sweetest sensation I had ever
known to wake in the morning and hear soft singing
in the room where a fresh breeze was wandering. I saw
Stella standing at the window, her hair about her
shoulders, looking out. She turned when I stirred,
came over to kiss me, while her hair fell about my face,
and then cried, &#8220;Hurry! Hurry! I must get out into
the garden!&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently, hand in hand, we went over the new lawn
to the sundial which stood amid a ring of brilliant
blooms&#8211;which, however, had become unbelievably
choked with weeds in the ten days of my absence. The
gnomon was throwing a long shadow westward across
the VII. We filled the bird bath, which Peter had
neglected. We hurried through the orchard to the
brook, to see the flowers blooming there, and there,
alas! we found the volume of the stream shrunk to less
than half its former size. We ran to the rows of berry
vines to see how many had survived, and found the
greater part of them sprouting nicely; we went up the
slope into the rows of vegetables and inspected them;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
we rushed to see if all the roses were alive; we went to
the barn where Mike had just begun to milk, and sniffed
the warm, sweet odour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s better for any man to be married,&#8221; I heard
Mike saying to her, as I moved back toward the door.
Then he added something I could not hear, and she
came to me with rosy face. &#8220;The horrid old man!&#8221;
She was half laughing to herself.</p>

<p>The goods we had ordered began to arrive after breakfast,
Bert bringing them from the freight house in his
large wagon. I took the day off, and devoted the
morning to laying a stair carpet, probably the hottest
job I ever tackled. Thank goodness, the stairs went
straight up, without curve or angle! As I worked,
small feet pattered by me, up and down, and garments
from a big trunk in the lower hall brushed my face as
they were being carried past&#8211;brushed their faint feminine
perfume into my nostrils and made my hammer
pause in mid-air. After the carpet was laid, there were
a thousand and one other things to do. There were
pictures of Stella&#8217;s to be hung, and them we put in the
hitherto vacant room at the front of the house, next
to the dining-room, where Stella&#8217;s wall desk was also
placed, and a case of her books, and some chairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I can work here when you want to create
literature in your room, or I can receive my distinguished
visitors here when you are busy,&#8221; she laughed, setting
some ornaments on the mantel. &#8220;My, but I&#8217;ve got a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
lot of curtains to make! I never did so much sewing
in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bureaus were carried upstairs with Mike&#8217;s assistance,
and the ivory backs of a woman&#8217;s toilet articles
appeared upon them; open closets showed me rows of
women&#8217;s garments; glass candlesticks were unpacked
and set upon the dining-table, and the new dining-chairs
&#8220;dressed up&#8221; the room remarkably. Everywhere we
went Mrs. Pillig followed with dust pan and broom,
slicking up behind us. When night came it was still
an incomplete house&#8211;&#8220;Oh, a million things yet to get,&#8221;
cried Stella, &#8220;just one by one, as we can afford it, which
will be fun!&#8221;&#8211;but a house that spoke everywhere of a
dainty mistress. Outside, by the woodshed, was a pile
of packing-boxes and opened crates and excelsior.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s <i>your</i> work, Peter,&#8221; I said, pointing.</p>

<p>Peter looked rueful, but said nothing.</p>

<p>That evening I tried to work, but found it difficult,
for watching my wife sew.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve no technique,&#8221; I laughed.</p>

<p>She made a little <i>moue</i> at me, and went on hemming
the curtains, getting up now and then to measure them.
&#8220;Why should I have?&#8221; she said presently. &#8220;You
knew I was a Ph. D. when you married me. These
curtains be on your own head! I&#8217;m doing the best I
can.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was suddenly the suspicion of moisture in her
eyes, and I ran to comfort her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>&#8220;I&#8211;I so want to make Twin Fires lovely,&#8221; she added,
pricking her finger. &#8220;Oh, tell me I can, if I am only a
highbrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course the finger had to be kissed, and she had to
be kissed, and the hem had to be inspected and praised,
and now, long, long afterward, I smile to think how alike
we all of us are on a honeymoon.</p>

<p>It was the next morning that we resolved to begin the
pool. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect to be married again for several
years,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and so I&#8217;m going to take a holiday this
week. We&#8217;ll carry the vegetables to market and bring
back the cement, and begin on our water garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike loaded the wagon with peas, the last of the
rhubarb, and ten quarts of currants picked by Peter,
and off we started.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this horse&#8217;s name?&#8221; asked Stella, taking the
reins to learn to drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has none, I guess. Mike calls him &#8217;Giddup.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s Dobbin. He looks just like a Dobbin. He
has a kind of conventional, discouraged tail, like a Dobbin.
Giddup, Dobbin!&#8221;</p>

<p>The horse started to trot. &#8220;There, you see, it <i>is</i> his
name!&#8221; she laughed.</p>

<p>On Bentford Main Street we passed several motors
and a trap drawn by a prancing span, and all the occupants
stared at us, or rather at Stella, who was beaming
from her humble seat on the farm wagon more like an
eighteenth century shepherdess than a New England
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
farmer&#8217;s wife. We added over $3 more in the account
book with the market, and read with delight the grand
total of $40.80 already in two weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next year,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;ll double it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I spent the $3, and some more, for Portland
cement.</p>

<p>We got into our oldest clothes when we reached home,
I put on rubber boots, and we tackled the pool. Even
with the brook as low as it was, the engineering feat was
not easy for our unskilful hands. Peter soon joined us,
and lent at least unlimited enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter,&#8221; said I, &#8220;you never worked this hard splitting
kindlings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter grinned. &#8220;Ho, I like to make dams,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The first thing we did was to divert the brook by
digging a new channel above the spot where we were to
build the dam, and letting the water flow around to the
left, close to one of the flower beds. Then, when the
old channel had dried out a little, I spaded a trench across
it and two feet into the banks on each side, and with
Peter helping, filled the trench nearly full of the largest,
flattest stones we could find, which we all then tramped
upon to firm down. Then, a foot apart, we stood two
boards on edge across the space, to make a mould for the
concrete above the stones. I sent Peter with a wheelbarrow
to pick up a load of small pebbles in the road, of
the most irregular shape he could find, and I myself
dug deeper in the hole where I had got the sand when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
we built the bird bath, and brought loads of it to the
brookside. We dumped sand, pebbles, and cement into
a big box, one pail of cement to one pail of pebbles and
three of sand, and Peter and Stella fought for the hoe to
mix them, while I poured in the water from a watering-pot,
for I had read and seen the reason for the fact that
the success of the cement depends upon every particle
being thoroughly mixed. As fast as we had a box full of
mixture prepared, we dumped it into the mould between
the boards. It took an astonishing quantity of cement&#8211;quite
all we had, in fact&#8211;and to finish off the top
smooth and level I had to get the quarter bag left from
my orchard work and the bird bath. It was evening
when we had it done, and Peter, who had deserted us
soon after dinner to play ball, returned to beg us to take
the boards away, and grew quite unreasonable when we
refused.</p>

<p>That night there was a shower, and the brook rose a
trifle. When we hastened down through the orchard
after breakfast the new channel had curved itself still
farther, as streams do when once they get started off the
straight line, and had washed the southeast flower bed
half away. Stella, with a cry of grief, ran down the
brook into the pines, and came back with sadly bedraggled
<i>Phlox Drummondi</i> plants in her hands, their
trailing roots washed white, their blooms broken.
&#8220;Horrid brook,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s put it right back
into its proper place. I don&#8217;t like it any more.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>&#8220;A sudden change of habit is always dangerous,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;Put the plants in the mud somewhere till we can
set &#8217;em in again.&#8221;</p>

<p>We now took away the boards from the new dam,
which had begun to harden nicely. The next thing to
do was to stake out the pool above it. As the dam was
10 feet below the line between the proposed bench and
the front door of the house, the other end of the pool was
marked off 20 feet upstream, and between the two
extremes we dug out the soil into an oval basin. This
was easily accomplished by chopping out the turf with a
grub hoe, and then hitching Dobbin to the drag scraper.
The soil was a black, loamy sand, which came up easily,
and was hauled over and dumped for dressing on the site
of our little lawn beyond the pool. When we had the
basin excavated to a depth of about a foot, all three of
us (for Peter was once more on the job) scattered to
find stones to hold the banks.</p>

<p>New England farms are traditionally stony&#8211;till you
want stones. We ended by taking some here and there
from the stone walls after we had scoured the pasture
behind the barn for half a barrow load. When once
the circumference of the pool had been ringed with
stones, stood up on edge, we raked the bottom smooth,
sprinkled clean sand upon it, and were ready to let the
water against the dam as soon as the concrete hardened.
We gave it one more day, and then shovelled away the
temporary dam, filled up the new channel where it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
turned out of the old, and stood beside the dam while
the current, with a first muddy rush, swirled against it,
eddied back, and began very slowly to rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;She holds, she holds!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve forgotten
to put stones for the water to fall over upon.
It will undermine the structure if we don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Structure&#8217; is good,&#8221; laughed Stella, regarding our
little six-foot long and eighteen-inch high piece of engineering.</p>

<p>We shouted for Peter, and ran to the nearest stone
wall, tugging back some flat stones which we placed
directly below the dam for the overflow to fall on.
Then, while Stella sat on the bank and watched the
water rise, I shovelled some of the earth removed from
the basin into the now abandoned temporary channel,
and packed it down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, we can have fish in here,&#8221; cried Peter, who was
also watching the water rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can have a four-legged fish,&#8221; laughed Stella,
as Buster came down the bank with a gleeful bark and
went splash into the pool, emerging to shake himself
and spray us all.</p>

<p>I had scarce finished filling in the temporary trench,
and was setting the poor uprooted plants back into the
bed, with my back turned, when I heard a simultaneous
shout from Peter and Stella.</p>

<p>&#8220;One, two, three&#8211;and over she goes!&#8221; cried Stella.</p>

<p>I faced around just in time to see the first line of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
water crawling over the top of the dam, and a second
later it splashed on the stones below; behind it came
the waterfall.</p>

<p>Stella was dancing up and down. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a real
waterfall!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a real waterfall all
my own! Come on downstream and look back at it!&#8221;</p>

<p>From the grove below it certainly did look pretty,
flashing in the morning sun. &#8220;And when there are
iris blossoms, great Japanese iris, nodding over it!&#8221;
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, can&#8217;t we plant those right away?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Gardens are like Rome, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went back and surveyed our pool at close range.
It was clearing now. But the second pile of earth remained
to be removed from the west side. Peter and
I carted that off in wheelbarrows at once, dumping part
of it into the hole where we had dug the sand, and the
rest into a heap behind some bushes upstream for
future compost. Then we climbed the orchard slope
for dinner. Midway we looked back. There glistened
our pool, a twenty-foot brown crystal mirror, with
the four flower beds all askew about it, the ragged weeds
and bushes pressing them close, and beyond it only the
rough ground I had cleared with a brush scythe, and
the scraggly trees by the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas&#8221; said I, &#8220;now we&#8217;ve built the pool, we&#8217;ve got
to build a whole garden to go with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it tinkles! Hear it tinkle!&#8221; cried Stella.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>We listened, hand in hand. The tiny waterfall was
certainly tinkling, a cool, delicate, plashy sound, which
mingled with the sound of the breeze in the trees above
our heads, and the sweet twitterings of birds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, John, it&#8217;s a very nice dam, and a very nice
world!&#8221; she whispered, as we went through the door.
&#8220;And, after all, it seems to me the greatest fun of gardening
is all the nice other things it makes you want to
do after you&#8217;ve done the first one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said I sententiously, &#8220;is perhaps the secret
of all successful living.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span><a id='link_19'></a>Chapter XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE NICE OTHER THINGS</span></h2>

<p>A pool of water twenty feet long shining in the sun,
or glimmering deeply in the twilight, that and nothing
else save a few straggling annuals wrongly placed about
it&#8211;yet it made Twin Fires over, it caused us weeks of
toil, it got into our dreams, it got into our pockets, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I know why sunken gardens are so called,&#8221;
said Stella, as she figured out the cost of the fall bulb
planting we had already planned. &#8220;It&#8217;s because you
sink so much money in &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course there was little that we could do to the
margin of the pool that summer, but there was plenty
to do beyond the margin. The first thing of all was to
place the flower beds differently. This took considerable
experimenting, and Stella, being ingenious, hit
upon a scheme for testing various possible arrangements.
She filled all sorts of receptacles, from tumblers
to pitchers, with cut flowers, low and high, and
stood them in masses here and there, till the spot was
found where they looked the best. As the pool centred
on the line between the front door of the house and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
the yet-to-be-built garden bench against the stone wall,
and as the orchard came down to within forty feet of
the brook on the slope from the house, it was something
of a problem to lead naturally from a grassy orchard
slope into a water feature and a bit of almost formal
gardening, without making the transition stiff and
abrupt. We finally solved it with the aid of a lawn
mower, flower beds, and imagination.</p>

<p>Going over the grass between the last apple trees and
the brook again and again with the mower, I finally
reduced that section to something like a lawn, and also
kept mowed a straight path from the pool up to the
front door. Then, beginning just beyond the last
shadows, we cut a bed, thirty inches wide, on each side
of the line of the path, running parallel with it to within
ten feet of the pool; then they swung to left and right,
following the curve of the bank until they flanked the
pool. By planting low flowers at the beginning, and
gradually increasing their height till we had larkspur
and hollyhocks and mallow in the flanking beds, we
could both make the transition from orchard to water
feature, and also screen off the pool, increasing its intimacy,
without, however, hiding it from the front door,
where it was glimpsed down a path of trees and flowers.
Of course we had no flowers now in mid-July to put into
those beds, save what few we could dig up from elsewhere,
setting poor little annual phloxes two feet apart;
but we could, and did, use them for seed beds for next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
year&#8217;s perennials, and to the eye of faith they were
beautiful.</p>

<p>Now we were confronted by the problem of the other
side of the pool, which included the problem of how
to get to the other side! Stella suggested tentatively
a tiny Japanese moon bridge above the pool, but I
would have none of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only way to build a Japanese garden in New
England is to utilize New England features,&#8221; I insisted.
&#8220;We won&#8217;t copy anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;then we want stepping-stones
above the pool, and some more down below the
dam, where we can see the waterfall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More suitable&#8211;and much easier,&#8221; I agreed.</p>

<p>Once more we robbed the stone wall, building our
two flanking paths of stepping-stones to the other side
of the brook.</p>

<p>On the other side we decided to eliminate all flower
beds in the open, merely planting iris and forget-me-not
on the rim of the pool. We would clear out a wide
semicircle of lawn, with the bench at the centre of the
circumference, and plant our remaining flowers against
the shrubbery on the sides, which was chiefly the wild
red osier dogwood (<i>cornus stolonifera</i>). I got a brush
scythe, a hatchet, a spade, a grub hoe, and a rake, and
we went to work.</p>

<p>Work is certainly the word. It was not difficult
to clear the brush and the tall, rank weeds and grasses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
away from our semicircle, which was hardly more than
thirty feet in diameter, but to spade up the black soil
thereafter, to eliminate the long, tenacious roots of the
witch grass and the weeds, to clear out the stubborn
stumps of innumerable little trees and wild shrubs which
had overrun the place, to spread evenly the big pile of
soil we had excavated from the pool, to reduce it all to
a clean, level condition for sowing grass, was more than
I had bargained for. Stella gave up helping, for it was
beyond her strength; but I kept on, through the long,
hot July afternoons, and at last had it ready. The
time of year was anything but propitious for sowing
grass seed, but we planted it, none the less, trusting
that in such a low, moist spot it might make a catch.
Then we turned to the bench.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious, you have to be everything to be a gardener,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Stella laughed, as we tried to draw a sketch
first, which should satisfy us. &#8220;The bench ought to
balance the old Governor Winthrop highboy top of the
front door. But I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;re
going to make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Patience,&#8221; said I, turning the leaves of a catalogue
of expensive marble garden furniture. &#8220;Just a simple
design of the classic period will do. Colonial furniture
was based on the Greek orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>We found at last the picture of a marble bench which
could be duplicated in general outline with wooden
planking, so I telephoned to the lumber dealer in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
next town for two twenty-four-inch wide chestnut
planks, and was fairly staggered by the bill when it
came. It appears that a twenty-four-inch wide plank
nowadays has to come from North Carolina, or some
other distant point, and is rarer than charity, at least
that is what they told me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be cheaper in marble,&#8221; said Stella.
&#8220;And it looks to me as if you could make the bench out
of one plank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We want another bench on the sundial lawn,&#8221; said
I, wisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do <i>now</i>,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if I hadn&#8217;t got two planks,&#8221; said I, &#8220;and had
spoiled the first one, then we&#8217;d have had to wait two or
three days again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was the reason!&#8221; she smiled.</p>

<p>I sawed one of the planks into one six-foot and two
two-foot lengths, and rounded the edges of the long piece
for the top. Then, on the two short lengths, we carefully
drew from the picture the outline of the supports
on the marble original, and went to work with rip saw,
hatchet, and draw knife to carve them out. The seasoned
chestnut worked hard, and we were half a day about
our task. The next day we put the three pieces together
with braces and long screws, planed and sandpapered
the wood till we had it smooth, and then painted
it with white enamel paint. While the first coat was
drying, we made a deep foundation of coal ashes and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
flat stones for the bench to rest on, and the next afternoon,
when the second coat, which Stella had applied
before breakfast, was nearly dry, I hove the heavy thing
on a wheelbarrow, and carted it around the road to the
point where it was to go. We put a little fresh cement
on the foundation stones to hold the two legs, and with
Mike&#8217;s aid the bench was lifted over the stone wall,
through the hedge of ash-leaf maples, put in place, and
levelled. Stella hovered near, with the can of paint, to
cover our fingermarks and give the top a final glistening
coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; I cried, as the job was done, &#8220;we have our
pool and our garden bench! We have some of our
flowers already planted for next year! We have our
bit of lawn! Let&#8217;s go up the orchard to the front door
and see how it looks.&#8221;</p>

<p>I left the wheelbarrow forgotten in the road, and we
ran up the slope together, turned at the door, and gazed
back. The pool shimmered in the afternoon sun. We
could hear the water tinkling over the dam. Beyond
the pool was the dark semicircle of fresh mould that was
to be green grass backed by blossoms against the
shrubbery, and finally, at the very rear, now stood the
white bench, from this distance gleaming like marble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine! It looks fine!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>Stella&#8217;s eyes were squinted judicially. &#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;I wish there was a cedar, a tall, slender, dark
cedar, just behind the bench at either end. And, John,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
do you know we ought to have some goldfish in the
pool?&#8221;</p>

<p>I sighed profoundly. &#8220;You are a real gardener,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;Nothing is ever finished!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I am,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;But we will have
the goldfish, won&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and the cedars, too,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask Mike
when is the best time to put &#8217;em in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mike was sure that spring was the best time, and
there were some good ones up in our pasture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, spring is the best time for <i>everything</i>, it
seems to me, and here it&#8217;s only July!&#8221; cried Stella.
&#8220;Well, anyhow, I&#8217;m going to draw a plan of the pool
garden, and hang it over my desk.&#8221;</p>

<p>She got paper and pencil and drew the plan, while I
lay under an orchard tree listening to the tinkle of the
waterfall and watching her while Buster came and licked
my face.</p>

<p>The plan appears on the following page:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think your arrangement of iris on the edge is rather
formal,&#8221; I was saying, &#8220;and it would be rather more
decorous, if not decorative, for you to sit upon the
bench, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221; when we heard a motor rumble over the
bridge at the brook, and the engine stop by our side
door.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span><a id='link_20'></a>Chapter XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>CALLERS</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; cried Stella, leaping to her feet, &#8220;do
you suppose it&#8217;s callers?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked ruefully at her paint-stained fingers, at
her old, soiled khaki garden skirt which stopped at least
six inches from the ground, and then at my get-up,
which consisted of a very dirty soft-collared shirt, no
necktie, khaki trousers that beggared description, and
soil-crusted boots. Some passengers from the motor
were unquestionably coming up our side path&#8211;they
were coming around the corner by the lilac bush to the
front door&#8211;they were around the lilac bush&#8211;they were
upon us!</p>

<p>We looked at them&#8211;at a large, ample female in a
silk gown anything but ample, at a young woman
elaborately dressed, at a smallish man with white hair,
white moustache, and ruddy complexion, clad in a
juvenile Norfolk jacket and white flannels.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are coming to call!&#8221; whispered Stella. &#8220;The
Lord help us! John, I&#8217;m scared!&#8221;</p>

<p>We advanced to meet them, and as I glanced at my
wife, and then at the ample female, I was curiously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
struck with their resemblance to a couple of strange
dogs approaching each other warily. I fully expected
to see the stout lady sniff; she had that kind of a
nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I&#8217;m Mrs. Eckstrom.
I presume this is Mr. and Mrs. Upton?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stella nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are your neighbours,&#8221; she continued, with an
air which said, &#8220;You are very fortunate to have us for
neighbours.&#8221; &#8220;We live in the first place toward the
village. This is Mr. Eckstrom, and my daughter, Miss
Julia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can hardly offer our hands,&#8221; said Stella. &#8220;Will
you forgive us? You see, we are making a garden, and
it&#8217;s rather messy work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You like to work in the garden yourself, I see,&#8221; said
Mrs. Eckstrom. &#8220;I, too, enjoy it. I frequently pick
rose bugs. I pick them before breakfast, very early,
while they are still sleepy. I find it is the only way to
save my tea roses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The early gardener catches the rose bug&#8211;I&#8217;ll remember
that,&#8221; Stella laughed. &#8220;Perhaps you would
care to see the beginnings of our little garden?&#8221;</p>

<p>We moved down through the orchard and surveyed
the pool. I suppose it did look bare and desolate to the
outsider, who did not see it, as we did, with the eye of
faith&#8211;the bare soil green with grass, the lip ringed with
iris blades, the shrubbery bordered with a mass of
blooms. At any rate, the Eckstroms betrayed no
enthusiasm.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i4'></a><img src='images/illus-246.jpg'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
We are your neighbours ... you are very fortunate to have us for neighbours
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>&#8220;Mr. Upton spaded all that lawn up himself, and we
made the bench together,&#8221; cried Stella.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, you <i>must</i> like to work,&#8221; said Mr. Eckstrom.
&#8220;It&#8217;s so much simpler to sic a few men on the
job. Besides, they can usually do it better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stella and I exchanged glances, and she cautioned me
with her eyes. But politeness was never my strong
point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; said I, &#8220;it happens that a chap who
wants a garden lacks the means to sic a few men on the
job. Under those conditions he may perhaps be pardoned
for labouring himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a slight silence broken by Stella, who said
that we were going to get some goldfishes soon.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can give them some out of our pool, can&#8217;t we,
father?&#8221; the other girl said, with an evident effort to be
neighbourly. &#8220;We really have too many.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, certainly; have Peter bring some over to-night,&#8221;
her father replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you!&#8221; Stella cried. &#8220;And will you have
Peter tell us their names?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Their what?&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Eckstrom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, haven&#8217;t they names? The poor things!&#8221; Stella
said. &#8220;I shall name them as soon as they come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a quaint idea,&#8221; the girl said, with a smile.
&#8220;Do you name all the creatures on the place?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Stella. &#8220;Come, I&#8217;ll show you Epictetus
and Luella.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a new one on me, but I kept silent, while
she led us around the house, and lifted the plank which
led up from the sundial lawn to the south door. Under
it were two enormous toads and two small ones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those big ones are Epictetus and Luella,&#8221; she announced,
&#8220;and, dear me, two children have arrived to
visit them since morning! Let me see.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dropped on her knees and examined the toads
carefully, while they tried to burrow into the soil backward,
to escape the sun. Our callers regarded her with
odd expressions of mingled amusement and amazement&#8211;or
was it pity?</p>

<p>&#8220;A son and daughter-in-law,&#8221; she announced, rising.
&#8220;They are Gladys and Gaynor.&#8221;</p>

<p>A polite smile flickered on the faces of our three visitors,
and died out in silence. Stella once more shot
a glance at me.</p>

<p>We turned toward the house. &#8220;If you will excuse
me for a few moments, I will make myself fit to brew
you some tea,&#8221; said my wife, holding open the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very kind, but we&#8217;ll not remain to-day, I
think,&#8221; Mrs. Eckstrom replied. &#8220;We will just glance
at what you have done to this awful old house. It was
certainly an eyesore before you bought it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>liked</i> it all gray and weathered,&#8221; Stella answered.
&#8220;In fact, I didn&#8217;t want it painted. But apparently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
you have to paint things to preserve them. Still, the
Lord made wood before man made paint.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He also made man before man made clothes,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>A polite smile from the girl followed this remark.
Her father and mother seemed unaware of it. They
gave our beautiful living-room a casual glance, and the
man took in especially the books&#8211;in bulk.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are one of these literary chaps, I hear,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I suppose you need all these books in your business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, hardly all,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Some few I read
for pleasure. Will you smoke?&#8221;</p>

<p>I offered him a cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, no,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Doctor&#8217;s orders. I can
do nothing I want to. Diet, and all that. Damn nuisance,
too. Why, once I used to<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;don&#8217;t you want to see if the
car is ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>The look of animation which had come over the man&#8217;s
face when he began to talk about his ill health vanished
again. He started toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me,&#8221; said I, springing ahead of him.</p>

<p>The car, of course, was waiting, the chauffeur sitting
in it gazing vacantly down the road, with the patient
stare of the true flunkey. I came back and reported.
With a polite good-bye and an invitation to call and
see their garden, our guests departed.</p>

<p>Stella and I stood in the south room and listened to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
the car rumble over the bridge. Then we looked at one
another in silence.</p>

<p>Presently she picked up what appeared like a whole
pack of calling cards from the table, and glanced at
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s begun. They&#8217;ve called on me.
I shall have to return the call. Are all the rest like
them, do you suppose? Are they all so deadly dumb?
Have they no playfulness of mind? I tried &#8217;em out on
purpose. They don&#8217;t arrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re rich,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Almost all rich people are
bores. We bored them. The old man, though, seemed
about to become quite animated on the subject of his
stomach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stella laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m <i>glad</i> we were in old clothes,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;And aren&#8217;t Epictetus and Luella darlings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; I cried, &#8220;why haven&#8217;t I met them
before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just discovered them this noon,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;You were working at the time. I was saving them
for a surprise after supper. I&#8217;m glad Gladys and Gaynor
brought no grandchildren, though. It would have
been hard to name so many correctly right off the bat,
and it&#8217;s terrible to start life with a wrong name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As Mike would say, it is surely,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;That
is why they were careful to call you Stella.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like the name?&#8221; she whispered, creeping
close to me. &#8220;Oh, John, I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re not rich like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
them&#8221;&#8211;with a gesture toward the pack of calling
cards&#8211;&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we can work in the garden with our
own hands and play games with toads and just be ourselves.
Let&#8217;s <i>never</i> be rich!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise,&#8221; said I, solemnly.</p>

<p>Then we laughed and went to hear the hermit thrush.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span><a id='link_21'></a>Chapter XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>AUTUMN IN THE GARDEN</span></h2>

<p>I SPENT considerably more money in July and August.
Some of the items would be regarded as necessities
even by our rural standards; some my farming
neighbours would deem a luxury, if not downright
folly. I was a green farmer then; I am a green farmer
still; but as I began to get about the region a little more
that first summer, especially at haying time, I was
struck with the absurd waste of machinery brought
about by insufficient care and lack of dry housing, and
I began to do some figuring. All my rural neighbours,
even Bert, left their ploughs, harrows, hay rakes, mowers,
and even their carts, out of doors in rain and sun
all summer, and many of them all winter. A soaking
rain followed by a scorching sun seemed to me, in my
ignorance, a most effective way of ruining a wagon, of
shrinking and splitting hubs, of loosening the fastenings
of shafts even in iron machinery. Neither do rusted
bearings wear so long as those properly protected. I
began to understand why our farmers are so poor, and
I sent for Hard Cider.</p>

<p>Just behind the barn he built me a lean-to shed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
about seventy-five feet long, open toward the east, and
shingled rainproof. It cost me $500, but every night
every piece of farm machinery and every farm wagon
went under it, and the mowing-machine was further
covered with a tarpaulin. For more than a year my
shed was the only one of the kind in Bentford, and that
next winter I used to see machinery standing behind
barns, half buried in snow and ice, going to pieces for
want of care. I verily believe that the New England
farmer of to-day is the most shiftless mortal north of
the Mason and Dixon line&#8211;and he hasn&#8217;t hookworm
for an excuse.</p>

<p>My next expenditure was for a cement root cellar,
which scarcely needs defence, as I had no silo on the
barn, and it would not pay to install one for only two
cows. But the third item filled Mike with scorn. I
had been making him milk the cows out of doors for
some weeks, taking a tip from one of the big estates,
and keeping an eye on him to see that he washed his
hands properly and put on one of the white milking
coats I had purchased. His utter contempt for that
white rig was comical, but when I told him that I was
going to have a cork and asphalt brick floor laid in the
cow shed, he was speechless. He had endured the
white apron, and the spectacle of the tuberculin test
(the latter because the law made him), but an expensive
floor in the barn was too much. He gave me
one pitying look, and walked away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>The floor was laid, however, and when it was completed,
and the drainage adjusted, Hard Cider trimmed
up the supports of the barn cellar door and the two
cellar window frames behind, and built in substantial
screens. I didn&#8217;t tell Mike about them till they were
all in. Then I showed them to him, and told him he
was to keep them closed under penalty of his job, and
he was further to sprinkle chloride of lime on the manure
once a week.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I niver seen screens on a barn before,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;and I guess nobody else iver did. Shure, it&#8217;s to be
spendin&#8217; your money azy ye are. Are yez goin&#8217; to
put in a bathroom for the horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bert was almost as scornful of the screens as Mike,
though he understood the cork-asphalt floor, having, in
fact, unconsciously persuaded me to install it by telling
me how the cows of a dairyman in the next town had
been injured by slipping on a concrete floor. My floor
had the advantages of concrete, but gave the cows a
footing. There had never been screens on a barn in
Bentford before, however, nor any chloride of lime
used. This was too much for Bert. But Mrs. Bert
was interested. After our screens had been on ten days
and the barn cellar had been limed, Mrs. Pillig pointed
out that the number of flies caught on the fly paper on
the kitchen door had decreased at least 400 per cent.
&#8220;And I think what&#8217;s there now come down from your
place,&#8221; she added to Mrs. Bert. The next thing we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
knew, Bert was talking of screening his stable. Truth
compels me to admit, however, that he never got beyond
the talking stage.</p>

<p>In the face of these expenditures, our garden expenses
were a mere song, yet we had begun to plant and
plan for the following year as soon as the pool was done.
We knew we were green, and we did not scorn the advice
of books and still more of our best practical friend&#8211;the
head gardener on one of the large estates, who knew
the exactions of our climate and the conditions of our
soil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plant your perennial seeds in as rich and cool a
place as you can,&#8221; he told us, &#8220;and expect to lose at
least three fourths of your larkspur. When your foxglove
plants are large enough to transplant, make long
trenches in the vegetable garden, with manure at the
bottom and four inches of soil on top, and set in the
plants. Do it early in September if you can, so that
they can make roots before our early frosts. Then you&#8217;ll
have fine plants for bedding in spring. If you buy any
plants, get &#8217;em from a nursery farther north if possible.
They have to be very hardy here.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went through the seed catalogues as one wanders
amid manifold temptations, but we kept to our purpose
of planting only the simpler, more old-fashioned blooms
at present. In addition to the bulbs, which came later,
we resolved to sow pansies, sweet William, larkspur,
Canterbury bells, foxglove, peach bells, Oriental
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
poppies, platicodon, veronica, mallow (for backing to the
pool especially), hollyhocks, phlox (both the early variety,
the divaricata, blooming in May, and, of course,
the standard decussata. The May phlox we secured in
plants). All these seeds were carefully planted in the
new beds between the pool and the orchard, where we
could water them plentifully, and Stella, with the instincts
of the true gardener, babied and tended those
seedlings almost as if they were human. Without her
care, probably, they would never have pulled through
the dry, hot weeks which followed.</p>

<p>We used to walk down to see them every morning
after breakfast, when Stella watered them, dipping the
water from the pool and sending Antony and Cleopatra
scurrying. Antony and Cleopatra were the goldfish
which the Eckstroms, true to their promise, had sent us.
The poor things were unnamed when they arrived, but
their aspect&#8211;the one dark and sinuous, the other pompously
golden&#8211;betrayed their identity. Stella called
a few days after their arrival, to convey our thanks&#8211;carefully waiting till she saw the Eckstroms driving
out in their car! Their curiosity having been satisfied
regarding us, and our thanks having been rendered to
them, further intercourse lapsed. We have never tried
to maintain relations with those of our neighbours who
bore us, or with whom we have nothing in common.
Life is too short.</p>

<p>Not only did Stella water the seedlings religiously,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
but she kept the soil mulched and the weeds out, working
with her gloved hands in the earth. All the seeds
came up well save the phlox, with which we had small
luck, and the <i>Papaver Orientalis</i>, with which we had no
luck at all. Not a seed came up, and not a seed ever
has come up in our soil. We have had to beg the plants
from other people. Even as the gardener predicted,
the tender little larkspur plants mysteriously died. We
ringed them with stiff paper, we surrounded them
with coal ashes, we even sprayed them with Bordeaux
and arsenate of lead. But still they were devoured
at the roots or the tops, or mysteriously gave up the
ghost with no apparent cause. We started with two
hundred, and when autumn came we had just thirty
left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; said Stella cheerfully, &#8220;thirty will make
quite a brave show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they survive the winter,&#8221; said I gloomily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
not the patience to be a gardener.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> a good deal like reform!&#8221; Stella replied.</p>

<p>As the busy autumn days came upon us, Twin Fires
took on a new aspect, and one to us greenhorns indescribably
thrilling. In the first place, our field of
corn rustled perpetually as we walked past it, and down
in the greenish-golden lanes beneath we could see the
orange gleam of pungkins (I shall so spell the word lest
it be mispronounced by the ignorant). Great ears of
the Stowell&#8217;s evergreen were ripe, for Mike&#8217;s prediction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
about the early frost had not come true, and we ate
the succulent food clean to the cob every day at dinner,
besides selling many dozens of ears to the market. In
the long light of afternoon, Stella loved to go along the
path by the hayfield wall and then turn in amid the
corn, losing sight at once of all the universe and wandering
in a new world of rustling leaves. She felt, she
said, just as Alice must have felt after she had eaten the
cake; and once a rabbit bounded across her foot, to her
unspeakable delight. She looked to see if he had dropped
his gloves!</p>

<p>Then there was the potato field. We were eating
our own new potatoes now. Often Stella dug them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems so funny to go and dig up a potato,&#8221; she
declared. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always felt that potatoes <i>just were</i>.
But to see the whole process of growth is quite another
matter. Oh, John, it makes them so much nicer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Especially when you are getting seventy-five cents
a bushel for them,&#8221; I laughed.</p>

<p>The loaded tomato vines, too, with the red fruit
hanging out from the wire frames and sending a pungent
odour into the surrounding air, appealed to Stella
endlessly. I used to see her now and then, as I glanced
from the south room of a morning, eating a raw tomato
like an apple, her head bent forward so that the juice
would not spoil her dress.</p>

<p>And there were the apples! Already a red astrachan
tree invited us on every trip to the brook, and other old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
trees were bearing fast reddening fruit. I had wanted
to set out more orchard, but we agreed that we could
not afford it that year, if we were to build chicken
houses against the spring, so I reluctantly gave up the
idea. But our old trees, in spite of (or perhaps because
of) my spring pruning, were doing fairly well. We had
enough for baked apples and cream all winter, anyhow,
Stella reckoned, smacking her lips at the thought.</p>

<p>Every day, on our way to the pool, one or the other
of us took a hoe along and scraped a tree for five minutes,
gradually getting the old bark off, and making a
final preparation for a thorough spraying the next
winter just so much easier. I used to prune a bit, too,
in spare moments, so that by the end of the summer
considerable renovation had been accomplished.</p>

<p>And now came the foxglove transplanting. According
to the gardener&#8217;s directions, we took two long rows
where the early peas had stood (and where Mike had
disobeyed my instructions to spade the vines under,
that being a form of green manuring your old-time gardener
will not see the value of, I have discovered),
trenched them, put in manure and soil, and set out
at least 300 foxglove plants six inches apart. It was a
cool, cloudy day, and they stood up as though nothing
had happened. Then, as an experiment, we moved
scores of tiny hollyhocks from the crowded seed beds
into their permanent position as a screen between the
south kitchen windows and the sundial lawn, and as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
border on the west side of the same lawn. They, too,
were quite unaffected by the change.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we ordered our bulbs&#8211;hyacinths, daffodils
(which in our climate refuse to take the winds of
March with beauty, cowardly waiting till May), a few
crocuses, <i>Narcissus poeticus</i>, Empress narcissus, German
iris, Japanese iris, and Darwin tulips. We ordered
the iris and tulips in named varieties.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have such nice names,&#8221; said Stella, &#8220;especially
the Japanese iris&#8211;Kimi-no-megumi, Shirataki, Momochiguma!
The tulips are nice, too. Here is Ariadne
and Kate Greenaway hobnobbing with Professor Rauwenhoff!
What&#8217;s the use of having plants that aren&#8217;t
named? We must show them as much respect as Antony
and Cleopatra, or Epictetus and Luella!&#8221;</p>

<p>We also experimented with lilies&#8211;lemon lilies for
the shady north side of the house, tigers for the border
beyond the pool, and two or three of the expensive
Myriophyllums, just to show that we, too, could
go in for the exotic, like our neighbours on the big
estates.</p>

<p>When the bulbs came, in October, we looked at the
boxes sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; said Stella, &#8220;you can&#8217;t be lazy and have a
garden, can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t work to-morrow, I guess,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Shall
we ask Mike&#8217;s Joe to help us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; said my wife. &#8220;We&#8217;ll put these bulbs in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
ourselves. If I had any help, I should feel like the Eckstroms,
which God forbid!&#8221;</p>

<p>So the next day at seven-thirty we began. We
ringed the pool with German and Japanese iris, alternated
for succession, and planted a few Japanese both
below and above the pool, close to the brook. We set
the <i>Narcissus poeticus</i> bulbs where, if they grew, the
flowers could look at themselves in the mirror below the
dam. The Empress narcissus we placed on both sides
of the pool just beyond the iris. On each side of the
bench we placed a bulb of our precious Myriophyllums,
and put the tigers into the borders close to the shrubbery
on both sides. The hyacinths went into the sundial
beds, the Darwins into the beds at the base of the
rose aqueduct, a few crocuses into the sundial lawn, and
the daffodils here and there all over the place, where the
fancy struck us and the ground invited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m going to label everything, and put it on a
map besides,&#8221; cried Stella, &#8220;except the daffodils. I
want to forget where they are. I want surprises in the
spring. Oh, John, do you suppose they&#8217;ll come up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose they will,&#8221; I laughed, &#8220;some of
them. But do you suppose we&#8217;ll ever get the kinks out
of our backs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to go doubled up the rest of my life, for
a garden of daffodils all my own,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;And then my heart with pleasure thrills</p>
<p>And dances with the daffodils<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>It was very thoughtful of old Wordsworth, and Shakespeare,
and Masefield, and all the rest to write nice
things about the daffodils, wasn&#8217;t it, John? I wonder if
gardens would be so wonderful if it weren&#8217;t for all their
literary suggestions, and the lovely things they remind
you of? Gardens have so much atmosphere! Oh,
spring, spring, hurry and come!&#8221;</p>

<p>I forgot my lame back in her enthusiasm, and later,
when the apples were gathered, the potatoes dug, the
beets and carrots in the root cellar, our own sweet cider
foamed in a glass pitcher on our table, and the first
snow spits of December whistled across the fields, we
put a little long manure over the irises and other bulbs,
and pine boughs over the remaining perennials, and
wrapped the ramblers in straw, with almost as much
laughing tenderness as you would put a child to bed.</p>

<p>The cows were back in the stable, and Mike had revised
his opinion of cork-asphalt floors when he realized
the ease of cleaning with a hose; the potatoes and apples
and onions and beets and carrots for our family use
were stored in barrels and bins in the cellar, or spread
on shelves, or buried in sand. The vegetable garden
was newly ploughed, and manure spread on the hayfield.
Antony and Cleopatra had been captured and
brought into the dining-room, where they were to spend
the winter in a glass bowl. Epictetus and Luella and
Gladys and Gaynor had all burrowed out of sight into
the ground. The pageant of autumn on our hills was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
over, only an amethyst haze succeeding at sunset time.
Wood fires sparkled on our twin hearths. The summer
residents had departed. Our first Thanksgiving turkey
had been eaten, though a great stone crock of Mrs.
Pillig&#8217;s incomparable mincemeat still yielded up its
treasures for ambrosial pies.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Stella, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to find out at
last what a country winter is like!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your friends are pitying you down in town,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to go back to them till
spring?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stella looked at the fires, she looked out over the bare
garden and the ploughed fields to the dun hillsides, she
listened a moment to the whistle of the bleak December
wind, she looked at me.</p>

<p>In her eyes I read her answer.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span><a id='link_22'></a>Chapter XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN PRAISE OF COUNTRY WINTER</span></h2>

<p>Those who know the country only in summer,
know it scarcely at all. From the first November snowstorm
to the last drift melting before the winds of
late March on the northern side of a pasture wall, the
winter season is a perpetual revelation of subtle colour
harmonies, of exquisite compositions, of dramas on the
trodden snow, of sweet, close-companioned hours before
wood fires that crackle, shut into &#8220;a tumultuous privacy
of storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our first winter began one bleak November day when
the lone pine in the potato field was outlined black
against a gray sky, and over the long mountain wall to
the northwest came suddenly a puff of white vapour, like
the beginning of artillery fire, and then the shrapnel of
the snow descended upon us. Wrapped against it, we
ran about the farm, marvelling at the transformations it
wrought. First it filled up the furrows on the ploughed
land, making our field like a zebra&#8217;s back. Then it
whitened the sundial lawn, reminding us to take the
wooden dial post in for the winter. Then it whitened
the brown earth around the pool, where our July-sown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
grass had failed to make a catch, and presently the pool
was a black mirror on a field of white.</p>

<p>Then, as a crowning touch, it powdered the pines, and
we ran among them. Under their thick shelter the
wind was not felt. We could hear the flakes hissing
against the needles overhead. All about us the white
powder was sifting down. A peep into the outside
world showed all distances blotted out by the storm.
By evening the grove was a powdered Christmas card,
the naked farm fields mantles of white laid upon the
earth, the lamps in our house beacons of warmth gleaming
behind us.</p>

<p>That snow melted, but others followed it, and by
Christmas we were, as Mike put it, snowed in for the
winter. In the barn was the warm smell of cattle. The
motors had disappeared from our roads, and we went
to the village in a pung, meeting other pungs on
the way. It was as if we had slipped back a whole
generation in time. Curiously enough, too, life became
more leisurely, more familiar. The great summer
estates were boarded up, the hotels closed. Only the
real village people sat in church or waited at the post-office.
We who in summer had known but few of our
townsfolk now became acquainted with them all. We,
too, left our pung in the horse sheds every Sabbath
morning, listened to the nasal drone of the village choir,
and joined in the social quarter-hour which followed
the service. It was an altogether different world we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
live in from the summer world, and we liked it even
better.</p>

<p>What walks we had! Either with stout boots along
the roads or with snowshoes into the deep woods, we
took our exercise almost daily by tramping, and to us
the countryside was a perpetual revelation. Almost
the first thing which impressed us was the colourful
quality of the winter landscape. Even on our own
thirty acres that was apparent. At sunset of a still,
peaceful day we could look forth from our south windows
across the white lawn to the dark green pines and beyond
them the exquisite iron-rust tamaracks, soft and
feathery. The eastern sky would be mother of pearl at
that hour, the southern sky blue, the western sky warm
salmon, green, and gold, and the encircling hills a soft
gray. Then, as the sun sank lower, a veil of amethyst
would steal mysteriously into the feathery tamaracks
and over the gray hills, all the upper air would blush to
rose, and for a brief ecstatic ten minutes nature would
sound a colour chord like a Mozartian andante.</p>

<p>Out on the roads we were charmed by the tawny tiger
colour of the willow shoots and the delicate lavender of
the blackberry vines rising from the snow beside a gray
roadside wall. On the edge of the woods a white birch
trunk, naked of leaves, would tell like a lightning stab
against the wall of pines, while in the woods themselves,
where the sunlight flickered through, the brook would
wander black as jet beneath beautifully curved banks of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
snow, and a laurel bush or fern would stand out a
vivid green in a shaft of sunlight; or even a spot
of brown leaves, where a pheasant or partridge had
scratched, would disclose in its centre the vivid red of
a partridge berry, a tiny woodland colour note that we
loved.</p>

<p>And how close our wild neighbours came in the winter!
We kept out a constant supply of suet and sunflower
seeds on two or three downstair window ledges, and
while we were dining, or reading in the south room, we
could look up at any time and see chickadees or juncos
or nuthatches just beyond the pane. The pheasants,
too, came to our very doors in winter, leaving their unmistakable
tracks, for they are walking birds and set
their feet in a single line.</p>

<p>It was not long before we began to find tracks of
four-footed wild things, a mink by the brook, a deer in
the pasture, and finally a fox which, unlike Buster,
tracked with one footprint in the other, leaving apparently
but two marks. We followed him a long way
on our snowshoes&#8211;up through our pasture and across
Bert&#8217;s to Bert&#8217;s chicken house, and then out across the
fields and into the woods. Stella had never tracked
before, and she was as keen on the scent as a Boy Scout,
reconstructing the animal&#8217;s actions in her imagination
as she went along. We lost the trail finally where it
crossed a road, but we picked up deer tracks instead,
and found a spot where they had eaten from the sumach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
bushes, and another where they had pawed up the snow
for frozen apples in an old abandoned orchard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if they&#8217;d only come into <i>our</i> orchard!&#8221; cried
Stella.</p>

<p>It was not long afterward, one moonlight night, that
I chanced to be sitting up late, and before retiring I
glanced from the window. There was something&#8211;there
were two somethings&#8211;moving about amid the apple
trees. I looked closer and ran to awake Stella. Wrapped
in a dressing-gown, she came with me to the window and
peered out. There, in the full moonlight which flooded
the white world with a misty silver radiance, were two
deer pawing for apples in our orchard. Buster, by
some sixth sense, suddenly scented them, and we heard
him set up an alarm in the kitchen. The buck shot up
his head and listened, a beautiful sight which made
Stella gasp for breath. We heard the horse stamp in the
stable, and Buster continued his yelps. But the buck
was evidently satisfied of his safety, for he lowered his
muzzle into the snow again. However, as we watched,
there came a different sound to his ears, though not to
ours, for suddenly he gave a leap, and with the doe after
him took the stone wall at a bound, the wall across the
road at another, and vanished up our pasture. A
moment later we, too, heard the sound; it was the jingle
of approaching sleigh-bells.</p>

<p>Stella sighed happily as she went back to bed. &#8220;All
my dreams are coming true!&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>I wonder if any pleasure in this world is quite comparable
with that of coming back to your own snug
dwelling after a long tramp through the snowy woods,
returning when the green sunset is fading in the west
and the amethyst shadows are creeping up the hills
and the cold night stillness is abroad, and seeing from
afar the red window-squares of home gleaming over the
snow? Our favourite method of return was to climb
the stone wall by the frozen tamarack swamp and enter
the pines, where the ice-covered brook crept like a flowing
black ribbon through the white, with the snow on
the banks curled over it in the most exquisite and fantastic
of tiny cornices. We could see our south windows
through the branches, just before the path emerged, and
Mrs. Pillig had orders to light the lamps before our return
so that they might glow a welcome. We always
stood a moment, hand in hand, regarding them, before
we climbed the slope and entered the door.</p>

<p>Ah, the warmth that greeted us when we stepped inside!
The good smell of burning apple wood on the
twin hearths! The cheerful bark of Buster, if he had
not gone to walk with us! The prophetic rattle of dishes
and the kettle song from the kitchen! We had a
kettle of our own, too, now, in the long room. It hung
on a crane in the west fireplace, and was delightfully
black, and often made the tea taste smoky, like camp
tea. Quickly we left our wraps in the hall, quickly
Stella brought out cups and tea caddy to a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
tabouret before the western fireplace, and sitting on our
settle in the chimney nook, with the last wan light of
sunset competing with the evening lamps, we warmed
our hands before the blaze, and drank our tea, and felt
that delicious drowse steal over us which comes only
after brisk exercise in the mountain air of winter.</p>

<p>And then the evenings, the long winter evenings by
the twin fires, when we were supposed by our friends in
town to be pining for the opera or the theatre, and were
in reality blissfully unaware of either! Stella&#8217;s first
duty after supper was to hear Peter&#8217;s lessons, while
Buster lay on the hearth and I sprawled in a Morris
chair with my cigar, and read the morning paper. That
is another delightful feature of country life. You never
have time to read the morning paper till evening, and
then you read it comfortably all through, if you like.
Peter was going far ahead of his class as a result of this
individual instruction, and had actually begun to develop
a real interest in the acquisition of knowledge&#8211;a
thing that did not exist as a rule in the pupils of Bentford,
which, perhaps, was not the pupils&#8217; fault. So far
as I have observed, it is not characteristic of most of our
public schools in America. Perhaps that is a penalty of
democracy; certainly it is a penalty of too large classes
and too low salaries paid for teaching. We make the
profession of teacher a stop-gap for girls between the
normal school and matrimony.</p>

<p>When Peter&#8217;s lesson was over, and we were left alone,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
we had the best books in the world, the best music in
the world, to choose from. We could have a play if we
liked, the kind too seldom seen on Broadway. We
could have Mozart, or so much of him as Stella could
render. We had letters to write, also, a task always
left till evening. Sometimes I had tag ends of my
morning labours to finish up. Any writing of my own
I brought forth in the evening for Stella to read, and to
criticise as mercilessly as she chose&#8211;which was sometimes
very mercilessly; and we thrashed it over together.
Sometimes, even, I agreed with her!</p>

<p>Once a week we gathered in several high school pupils
who lived near by&#8211;Mike&#8217;s Nora, a boy, and three other
girls&#8211;and read Shakespeare. It took them two months
to read one play in school, but we read a play in two or
three evenings, each of us taking a part. I showed them
pictures of the ancient playhouses, and explained as
best I could the conditions of stage productions in various
periods. Stella supplied the necessary philology.
We had a real course in Shakespeare, and yet one
which interested the children, for they were reading the
plays aloud, and visualizing them. One evening we
dressed up in costume, so far as we could, amid much
laughter, and acted a scene from &#8220;As You Like It,&#8221;
with Nora as Rosalind (she wore my knickerbockers
and a long cape of Stella&#8217;s, and blushed adorably), and
Mrs. Pillig and Peter called in as audience.</p>

<p>Before the winter was over, two or three other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
children from the village had begged to come to the
class, and made the long, cold trip out to the farm on
foot every week. We had cake and chocolate when the
lessons were over. As Stella and I stood in the door
listening to the young voices die away down the road,
we used to look at one another happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she once cried, &#8220;how much you can do for
folks in the country! In town we&#8217;d pay $4 to see
Shakespeare, played by professionals, and then go selfishly
home. Here we can help give him to these children,
with all that means. And some of them so need
it! Why, look at Joe Bostwick! When he first
began to come he had the manners of a bear, and read
like a seven-year-old child. I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;d <i>ever</i>
read out loud, or been of an evening among nice people.
Now he&#8217;s getting to know how to behave in company,
poor fellow, and he reads almost intelligently!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to go back to the city, then?&#8221; I
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, John, I never want to go back to the city,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;I want to live here forever. I want to do
more and more for these people. I want to do more
and more for Twin Fires. I want to know more and
more what I&#8217;ve never known&#8211;the sense of being rooted
to the land, of having a home. Our grandfathers used
to know that, but in our modern cities we have forgotten.
I want to die in the house I&#8217;ve always lived in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little soon to plan for that,&#8221; said I, as we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
entered the south room again, but I knew what she
meant.</p>

<p>The hour was late for us in the country&#8211;almost
eleven. We put away the cups and plates, and went
through our nightly ceremony of locking up. First, we
peeped out of the window at the thermometer, which
registered two degrees above zero, and I set it down in
my diary, for the temperature and the weather are important
items to record when you are a farmer. Then
we locked all the doors, giving Buster a pat as he lay
on his old quilt in a corner of the kitchen. The kitchen
lamp was out, and the room was lighted only by the
moon, but the kettle was singing softly. Then we returned
to the south room and banked the fires carefully,
so that the fresh logs would catch in the morning,
on top of the noble piles of ashes. Finally we blew out
the lamps. Cold moonlight stole in across the floor
from the glass door and windows, and met midway the
warm red glow from the fires. The world was very still.
The great room, so homelike, so friendly, so full of
beautiful things and yet so simple, seemed sleeping.
We tiptoed from it with a last loving glance and climbed
the stairs. In our dressing-room, which was an extra
chamber, an open fire burned, but in our chamber there
was no heat. The shades were up and the moonlight
showed the fairy frost patterns on the panes. We took
a last look out across the silvery world before we retired,
a last deep breath of the stinging cold air as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
windows were opened, and jumped beneath the covering,
with heavy blankets beneath us as well as above.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a very nice old world,&#8221; said Stella sleepily.
&#8220;Winter or summer, it is lovely. I think New York is
but a dream&#8211;and I hope it won&#8217;t be mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>I heard her breathing steadily a few minutes later,
and from far off somewhere in the outer world the
mournful whistle of a screech owl came to my ears, the
andante of the winter night. It seemed to intensify
the freezing silence. I thought how at college I used
to hear from my chamber the screech of trolley cars
rounding a curve and biting my nerves. I thought of
that lonely chamber, of all my life there, of Stella&#8217;s
life in the triple turmoil of New York. And I put out
my hand and took hers into it, while she stirred in her
sleep, her fingers unconsciously closing over mine. So
we awoke in the morning, with the sunshine smiting
the snow into diamonds and a chickadee piping for
breakfast.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span><a id='link_23'></a>Chapter XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>SPRING IN THE GARDEN</span></h2>

<p>The excitement of our first spring at Twin Fires
will probably never be equalled in our lives, though no
spring can recur in a garden without its excitements.
But about our first spring there was a glorious thrill of
the unexpected which, alas! can come but once. To
begin with, it was Stella&#8217;s initiation into rural April,
and the feet of the south wind walking up the land
brought hourly miracles to her sight. In the second
place, everything in the garden was an experiment.
The new hotbeds were an experiment. The bulbs and
perennials sown the year before were an experiment.
The ramblers were an experiment. The fertilizers I put
upon the soil (more or less to Mike&#8217;s disgust) were an
experiment. We were learning everything, and after
all no rapture is quite like that of learning.</p>

<p>The last snow melted and the ice went out of the
brook in March, but cold nasty weather followed for
two weeks. We planted a row of Spencers on March
20th, but it was not till the first day of April that we
could spade up 200-foot long rows in the vegetable
garden and plant early peas, which I inoculated with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
nitrogen-gathering bacteria while Mike looked on with
unconcealed scorn. I tried to explain the growing process
of legumes to him, but gave up the task as hopeless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bugs!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Puttin&#8217; bugs in the soil! No
good never came o&#8217; that. Manure&#8217;s the thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>About this time, too, we started the hotbeds, a long
row of them on the south side of the kitchen. The
fresh manure cost us $2 a load, for, owning but one horse,
we did not have enough in our stable; and, as Stella
said, the piles &#8220;steamed expensively,&#8221; like small volcanoes,
as they stood waiting in the sun after a warm,
drenching shower. We were all impatience to start our
beds, but Mike kept us waiting till the soil temperature
had gone down. Then the sowing began. While Mike
was putting in his beds large quantities of cauliflowers,
which had proved one of our most profitable crops the
year before, and celery and lettuce and tomatoes and
peppers and radishes and cabbages, we divided our beds
into one-foot squares, and sowed our different colours of
antirrhinum, asters, stock, <i>Phlox Drummondi</i>, cosmos,
annual larkspur, heliotrope, and <i>Dimorphotheca Aurantiaca</i>,
a plant chosen by Stella because she said the name
irresistibly appealed to a philologist. Later we agreed
that that was about its only appeal.</p>

<p>While the hotbeds were sprouting, demanding their
daily water and nightly cover, there was the ploughing
to be done, the perennial beds to be uncovered, the
new beds by the pool to be made ready, more pruning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
to be accomplished, and consequently more litter to be
removed, birds to be watched for excitedly, and crocus
spears in the grass, and, of course, the little lawn beyond
the pool to be sowed to grass, and some grass seeds
worked into the sundial lawn, which was still thin and
patchy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know which is the real sign of spring,&#8221;
said Stella, one evening, as we wandered on the terrace
before the south room and heard the shrill chorus of
the Hylas from our swamp. &#8220;Sometimes I think it&#8217;s
the Hylas, on the first warm evening; sometimes I think
it&#8217;s the fox sparrows who appeared suddenly the other
day at 10.01 <span class='sc'>a.m.</span> while you were working, and began
hippity-hopping all over the grass. Sometimes I think
it&#8217;s the soft coot-coot of our new hens in the sun. Sometimes
I think it&#8217;s a crocus leaf. Sometimes I think it&#8217;s
the steaming manure piles. Sometimes it seems to be
the figures of Mike and Joe driving old Dobbin and the
plough, against the sky and the lone pine, like a Millet
painting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lump them,&#8221; I suggested. &#8220;It&#8217;s all of them combined.
In New York it is when the soda fountains have
to be extended over the toothbrush counter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;New York!&#8221; sniffed Stella. &#8220;There <i>is</i> no such
place!&#8221;</p>

<p>April flew past us on gauzy wings, and May came,
with violets by our brook and in our pasture, and the
trilliums we had transplanted the year before burst into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
bud. Nearly all our perennials had come through the
winter, thanks to the sixty-seven days of snow, and the
one plant of blue May phlox which had survived its
fall planting made us eager for a second trial, the next
time in early spring. More sowings of peas went into
the ground. The sundial was set out. Hard Cider came
to build our pergola, and the clematis vines arrived to
grow over it. The grape arbour along the west side of
the sundial lawn was also built, of plain chestnut. The
perennials were all moved to their permanent places,
the beds fertilized and trimmed.</p>

<p>About the first of May, too, I took a tip from Luther
Burbank and put early corn into a mixture of leaf mould
and fresh manure in a big box. When the time came
the middle of the month for the first planting, my seeds
had developed snaky white roots and stalks. Again to
Mike&#8217;s disgust, I made a long trench and put these
sprouted seeds in thickly. In a couple of days they
were up, and by the time his conventionally planted
hills had sprouted, I had a long row of well-started corn
which I thinned out to the strongest stalks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mike,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;ll beat you and the town in
the market.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, bedad, it beats all how you fellers that don&#8217;t
know nothin&#8217; about farmin&#8217; can do some things,&#8221; he
said, regarding my corn with comical amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because we are willing to learn,&#8221; said I, and
left him still looking at the six-inch high stalks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>(Incidentally, I may remark that I did beat everybody
in the market, and made about $15 extra by my
simple experiment.)</p>

<p>But Stella&#8217;s chief joy in the garden was in the surprises
of the blooms: in the stately clumps of Darwins against
the pillars of the rose aqueduct; in the golden bursts of
daffodils here and there where we had sown a few bulbs
and forgotten the spot; in the <i>Narcissus poeticus</i>, which
were in their element close to the brook and did verily
look at themselves in the tiny pool below the dam; in
the pale gold ring of the great Empress narcissus bordering
the iris spears around the large pool; above all, perhaps,
in the maroon of the trilliums which we had
brought home from that first wonderful walk in the
woods. Not alone her heart, but her feet, danced with
the daffodils, and I could hear her of a morning as I
worked, out in the garden singing or bringing in great
bunches of blooms to decorate the house.</p>

<p>On several afternoons we made further trips to the
deep woods after wild-flower plants, and set them in
along our brook. The thrush had returned, the apple
blossoms had made all the garden fragrant while the
plants were budding (this year they were carefully
sprayed twice, for, though it cost nearly as much to
spray them as the entire value of the apples, one thing I
cannot stand on my farm is poor or neglected fruit;
besides, the improved aspect of the trees themselves
was worth the price). Now that their petals had fallen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
came the new fragrance, subtler but no less exquisite, of
many flowers after May rain, of a spring brook running
under pines, and near the house the pungent aroma of
lilacs.</p>

<p>Then came the German irises, like soldiers on parade,
around the pool, and the bright lemon lilies in the shady
dooryard. Scarce had the irises begun to fall when
the foxgloves began to blossom, and all suddenly one
morning after a very warm night the sundial was surrounded
by a stately conclave of slender queens dressed
in white and lavender, while more queens marched down
from the orchard to the pool, and yet more stood against
the shrubbery beyond it, or half hid the bare newness
of our grape arbour.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to take digitalis internally for a heart
stimulant!&#8221; cried Stella. &#8220;Oh, the lovely things! Quick,
vases of them below the Hiroshiges! Quick, your
camera! Quick, come and look at them, come and see
the bees swinging in their bells!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they are breakfast bells,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no time for bad puns,&#8221; she answered, dragging
me swiftly down through the orchard, and up again
to the sundial.</p>

<p>Indeed, the June morning was beautiful, and the foxgloves
ringing the white dial post above the fresh green
of our lawn had an indescribable air of delicate stateliness
in the sun. And they were murmurous with bees.
Again and again that morning I looked up from my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
work and saw them there, in the focussed sunlight, saw
my wife hovering over them, saw beyond them, through
the rose arches, Mike and Joe at work on the farm, saw
still farther away the procession of my pines, and then
the far hills and the blue sky. Again, at quiet evening,
when a white-throated sparrow and an oriole were competing
in song, we watched the foxgloves turn to white
ghosts glimmering in the dusk, we heard the bird songs
die away, the shrill of night insects arise, and then the
tinkle of our brook came into consciousness, as it ran
ever riverward in the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;The spring melts into summer,&#8221; said Stella, &#8220;as
gently as the little brook runs toward the sea. I wish
it would linger, though. Oh, John, couldn&#8217;t we build
a dam and hold back the spring? A little pool of
spring forever in our garden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have to make that pool within our hearts,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span><a id='link_24'></a>Chapter XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>SOME RURAL PROBLEMS</span></h2>

<p>There are many mysteries of marriage, quite unanticipated
by the bachelor before he changes his state.
Not the least of them is the new range of social relations
and impulses which follow a happy union. I do not
mean social relations with a capital S. About such I
know little and care less. Presumably marriage may
bring them, also, into the life of a man who chooses the
wrong wife. In fact, Stella and I have seen more than
one case of it in Bentford, where we dwell near enough to
the fringes of Society to observe the parasitic aspirations
of several ladies with more fortune than &#8220;position.&#8221;
Mrs. Eckstrom, we have discovered since her call, is
such a one. We, of course, were of no use to her, and
she had not troubled us since, though two gold fish did
arrive that night, as I have told. We are grateful for
Antony and Cleopatra.</p>

<p>No, what I mean by social relations and impulses
are the opportunities for service and the impulses to
jump in and help others, which matrimony discloses and
breeds. Who can say why this is so? Who can say
why the bachelor is generally negatively&#8211;if not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
actively&#8211;selfish, while the same man when he has
achieved a good wife, opened a house of his own, begun
to employ labour directly instead of through the
medium of a club or bachelor apartment hotel, is suddenly
aware of wrong conditions in the world about
him and a new desire to help set them right? It cannot
entirely be due to the woman, for very often her maiden
life has been as barren of social service as his own. It
is inherent in the state of matrimony, and to me it seems
one of the glories of that state. Those couples who
have not felt it, I think, have been but sterilely mated,
though they have reproduced their kind never so many
times.</p>

<p>At any rate, it was not long after the Eckstrom invasion
that Stella and I went to play golf, carrying a load
of lettuce heads and cauliflowers to market on our way.
As all Bert&#8217;s cauliflowers are sold in bulk to a New York
commission merchant, I found I had the local market
pretty much to myself, and was getting 15 cents a head
for my plants. Mike dearly loved cauliflowers, and
babied ours as a flower gardener babies his hybrid tea
roses. They were splendid heads, and were bringing me
in a dollar a day or more. I had visions of greatly increasing
my output another season, for I could easily
supply the two hotels as well.</p>

<p>We left our farm wagon in the church horse-sheds and
went down to the links. There was a crowd of caddies
of all ages sitting on the benches reserved for them, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
half a dozen came rushing toward us. I chose a large
boy, because I am one of those idiots who carries around
at least seven more clubs than he ever uses, and Stella
picked a smaller boy because she liked his face. As
golf is not an engrossing game when you are playing
with your wife, and she&#8217;s a beginner into the bargain
(matrimony has its drawbacks, too!) we fell to talking
with our caddies.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be in the high school, eh?&#8221; said I to
mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went last year,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; no
more. Goin&#8217; to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Work at your age? What are you going to do?&#8221;
asked Stella.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno&#8211;somethin&#8217;,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you keep on at school?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, what&#8217;s the use?&#8221; said he. &#8220;They don&#8217;t learn
you nothin&#8217;&#8211;algebra and English and stuff like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little English wouldn&#8217;t hurt you at all, young
man,&#8221; said Stella. &#8220;You don&#8217;t like to study, do
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy looked sheepish, but admitted that he didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you like to do?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
like to caddy very well, because you don&#8217;t keep your
eye on the ball, and you&#8217;ve made the little fellow take
out the pin on every hole so far.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy flushed at this, and went up to the next pin
himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to work in a garden,&#8221; he said, as we were
walking to the next tee.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to be a gardener, eh?&#8221; said I. &#8220;Has
anybody ever taught you how to start a hotbed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever run a wheel hoe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you know what date to plant early peas, and
corn, and lima beans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever graft an apple tree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re not very well fitted to take a job as a
gardener yet, are you?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>He admitted that he wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you keep on going to school if they taught
you how to be a gardener?&#8221; asked Stella, carrying on the
line of questioning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;But, gee! they don&#8217;t teach
nothin&#8217; like that. Only bookkeepin&#8217; and typewritin&#8217;,
and then you have to go away to a business college
somewhere before you can get a job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We seem to have stumbled on a civic problem,&#8221; I
remarked to my wife as we teed up. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
an educational survey would do this town any harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the finger of destiny points to us?&#8221; she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You&#8217;d hardly expect the Eckstroms
to tackle the job!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>That night we began by consulting Bert. Bert is
one of the best men I know, and he applies the latest
methods to growing cauliflowers; but he&#8217;s a New England
farmer, none the less, and he has the true &#8220;rural
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Vocational education!&#8217;&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;We got
more education than we kin afford now. Taxes are
way up, an&#8217; the school appropriation&#8217;s the biggest one
we have&#8211;$19,000, to only $7,000 for the roads! And
then you talk about more! We got along pretty well
without it so far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you, though?&#8221; said Stella. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a
high school, but how many boys have you got in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; said Bert.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. You don&#8217;t know. You don&#8217;t know anything
about what your schools are doing. You must
be on the school committee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bert grinned at this. &#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I
guess I&#8217;m ez good ez them that are. They do say
Buckstone&#8211;you know, the man who runs the meat
market&#8211;engages teachers on their looks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bad idea,&#8221; said Stella; &#8220;looks mean a lot to
children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the kind Buckie&#8217;s after, I reckon,&#8221; said Bert.
&#8220;But you two go run your farm an&#8217; don&#8217;t worry about
this town. We&#8217;ll git along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bert spoke good naturedly, but we felt, none the
less, as if he were rebuking us.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>&#8220;He thinks we are butting in,&#8221; said Stella, as we
walked home. &#8220;I suppose you have to live in a New
England town thirty years before you are really a citizen.
Well, I&#8217;m getting my mad up. Let&#8217;s butt!&#8221;</p>

<p>We next consulted Mrs. Pillig on the subject, and
found her as stiffly opposed to vocational education as
Bert, but on entirely different grounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want my boy educated as if he wa&#8217;n&#8217;t as
good as anybody else&#8217;s,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Just because I&#8217;m
poor is no reason why my boy shouldn&#8217;t be fitted to go
to college same as young Carl Swain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carl Swain was the son of the village bank president.
He, I happened to know, had been obliged to go to
Phillips Andover for a year after his graduation from
our high school before he could get into college.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;your high school
doesn&#8217;t fit for college now. In the second place, is Peter
going to college?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he ain&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mrs. Pillig.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why not educate him in some way that will
really fit him to make a better living, and be a better
man?&#8221; said Stella.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want he should have what the rest have,&#8221; the
mother stoutly maintained.</p>

<p>Stella shook her head. &#8220;It&#8217;s hopeless,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>I mentioned the matter next to Mr. Swain, when I
was in the bank. He, too, was a true New Englander,
of a different class from Bert, but with the fundamental
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
conservatism&#8211;to give it the pleasantest name possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s too much fol-de-rol in the school now,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;If they&#8217;d just try to teach &#8217;em Greek and Latin
and the things you need for a liberal education and the
college entrance examinations, I wouldn&#8217;t have had to
send my boy to Andover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your boy, yes,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;How many other
boys and girls in his class are going to college?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s another one,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of a class of how many?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm&#8211;you want to make your school entirely for
the 10 per cent., then?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had no very adequate reply, and I departed,
wondering anew at human selfishness. My next encounter
was with the rector. He didn&#8217;t believe in
vocational education, either. He had one of those
vague and paradoxically commendable though entirely
fallacious reasons for his opposition which are almost
the hardest to combat, because they are grounded in the
fetish of the old &#8220;humanist&#8221; curriculum (which when
it originated was strictly vocational). He didn&#8217;t believe
that trade instruction educated. There was no
&#8220;culture&#8221; in it. I left him, wondering if Matthew
Arnold hadn&#8217;t done as much harm as good in the world.</p>

<p>After that, Stella and I hunted up the superintendent
of schools. We brought him and his wife over to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
dinner, and sat in the orchard afterward, talking. He
was a pleasant man, who seemed to take a grateful interest
in our enthusiasm, but supplied no hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there are seventy-one girls and
eleven boys in the high school. It ought to be plain
that something is wrong. But you are in the Town
Meeting belt here, Mr. Upton, and you&#8217;ve got to get
your arguments through the skulls of every voter in the
place before we can have any money to work with.
The Town Meeting is your truest democracy, they say.
Perhaps that is why Germany has so much better
schools than we do in rural New England!&#8221;</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t quite believe him then, but I do now. I
have seen a Bentford Town Meeting! Stella and I
made a survey of the town during the ensuing autumn
and winter, with the aid of the Town Clerk and the
list of voters. As I have said, there are no manufactories
of any sort in Bentford. It is exclusively a residence
village, with a considerable summer population
of wealthy householders who pay the great bulk of our
taxes, and a considerable outlying rural population
engaged (however desultorily) in agriculture. Our
figures showed that out of a total voting population of
six hundred and one males, one hundred and twenty
were directly employed in some capacity as gardeners or
caretakers on the estates of others, one hundred and
forty were at least part time farmers, though they
worked on the roads and did other jobs of a similar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
nature when they could, and at least fifty more were
engaged in manual labour in some way connected with
the soil or with the roads or trees. Three hundred and
ten out of a total of six hundred and one, then, of the
adult males of Bentford, were in a position to benefit by
agricultural education&#8211;a truly tremendous proportion.
At the same time we learned that exactly eighteen boys
had gone to higher institutions of learning from the village
in the past decade, and a slightly greater number
of girls&#8211;most of the latter to normal school.</p>

<p>It was with such overwhelming figures as these,
backed up by the promise of state aid for an approved
agricultural course, which would reduce the expenses of
the town to $500 a year, that the superintendent of
schools and I, supported by a few members of the
Grange, went before the town at the annual Town Meeting
in March, and asked for an appropriation. Our
article in the warrant was laid on the table. The appropriation
committee refused to endorse it. The town
was too poor. It was going to cost $9,000 for roads
that year.</p>

<p>This would be rather amusing if it weren&#8217;t, as Stella
points out, so terribly tragic. The roads cost us $9,000
not alone because we do not employ a road superintendent,
and don&#8217;t know how to build them right, still
employing the ancient American method of scraping
back the gutters to crown the road anew every spring
(and this soil, furthermore, is now so saturated with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
oil that it makes a pudding whenever there is a heavy
frost), but because a great deal of the money evaporates
in petty graft. I had supposed that Tammany Hall
was the great grafting institution till I moved to a New
England small town. There I learned Tammany Hall
was, relatively, a mere child. I&#8217;ve told how selectman
Morrissy scraped my lawn&#8211;admitting I was party to
the crime. Since then I have learned how this same
Morrissy sold gravel to the town at 50 cents a load,
from a gravel bed the town already owned, and, as
selectman, O. K&#8217;d his own bill! I have seen how our
&#8220;honest farmers&#8221; rush to gobble their share of that
road appropriation as soon as Town Meeting is over,
hauling gravel where a good deal of the time it isn&#8217;t
needed, if the roads are properly made, getting their
teams on the job about an hour after contract time and
taking them home at night an hour early, and seeing to
it that all of the $9,000 is spent before July, so there is
nothing to repair roads with in the autumn. Of course
some roads do have to be repaired in the autumn, so the
selectmen used to overdraw the appropriation, and the
town was so much the poorer, and couldn&#8217;t afford an
extra $500 to educate its children properly. The law
has at least stopped the overdraft, but we still lack the
$500.</p>

<p>If an honest selectman gets into office and tries to let
out a road contract to a scientific builder, a storm of
protest goes up that he is taking away the bread from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
town labour, and the next year he is so snowed under at
the polls that you never hear of him again. He is
snowed under with equal effectiveness if he tries to keep
town labour up to contract, or tries to take away the
vicious drugstore liquor license. Fifty per cent. of our
working population are grafters, even when they don&#8217;t
know it. Twenty-five per cent. of our people&#8211;the
richest taxpayers, who are summer residents&#8211;don&#8217;t
care anyhow, so long as they can get men to look after
their estates. Also, these rich men are grafters, too, of
the worst kind, because they never declare a half of
their taxable personal property. Those of us who are
left are, as the expressive phrase goes, &#8220;up against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is what I told Stella as we came home from our
first Town Meeting. I was blue, despondent, ready to
give up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-five per cent. who really cared,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;could reform the universe. Reform is like the dictionary&#8211;it
takes infinite patience. The first thing is to get
the 25 per cent. together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right!&#8221; I cried, taking heart again. &#8220;There&#8217;s
plenty of work for our hands ahead! They think in
Bentford that we are mere upstarts because we&#8217;ve
lived here only a year or two. But that is just why we
can see so many things which must be altered. We&#8217;ve
got to keep our batteries on the firing line. We&#8217;ve got
plenty of work besides getting these hotbeds ready for
the spring planting and uncovering our perennials.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>We had reached home, and, as I concluded, we were
standing by the woodshed contemplating the new hotbed
sashes which had not been used the spring before.</p>

<p>It was those sashes which gave me the idea of school
gardens, I think. If we couldn&#8217;t have real vocational
instruction, at least we might have school gardens, with
volunteer instruction and prizes awarded, perhaps, by
the Grange. I sent away that evening for bulletins on
the subject, and presently took the matter up with the
school superintendent and the master of the Grange.
Results speedily followed. I discovered that, after all,
what our town chiefly lacked (and, inferentially, what
similar towns chiefly lack) was a spirit of co√∂peration
among those working for improvement. The selectmen
cheerfully gave the use of a piece of town land for the
gardens. One of our farmers cheerfully volunteered to
plough it. The Grange voted small money prizes as an
incentive to the children. And two gardeners on one of
the large estates (one of them an Englishman, at that,
who was not a citizen) volunteered to come down to the
gardens on alternate days, at five o&#8217;clock, and give instruction.
Finally, our Congressman from the district
sent quantities of government seeds, and more were
donated by one of the local storekeepers. In two
weeks we had a piece of land, nicely ploughed and
harrowed, divided into more than twenty little squares,
and in each square you could see of an afternoon a small
boy toiling. We had the beginnings of vocational
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
instruction. It had been entirely accomplished by voluntary
co√∂peration among the minority who saw the need
for it.</p>

<p>I was talking this over one day with our new selectman,
an Irish-American who had practically grown up
into the management of one of the large estates, where
he had a perfectly free hand, and his natural strength of
character had been developed by responsibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble is,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that we organize for
political parties, for personal ends, for the election of
individuals, but we don&#8217;t organize for the town. I
believe we could start a Town Club, say of twenty-five
or fifty men, with the sole object of talking over what
the town needs, and inaugurating civic movements.
That club would bring together forces that are now
scattered and helpless, and put the weight of numbers
behind them. There would be no politics in such a club.
It would be for the town, not for a party.&#8221;</p>

<p>He carried out his idea, too, and the Bentford Town
Club was the result. It meets now once every month,
and it gives voice to the hitherto scattered and ineffectual
minority.</p>

<p>It was this same selectman who altered some of my
ideas about grafting. I remarked one day that the
town didn&#8217;t get more than 60 cents&#8217; worth of labour
for every dollar it spent, and he answered: &#8220;Well, if
we didn&#8217;t pay some of those men $2 a day to shovel
gravel on the roads, or to break out the snowdrifts in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
winter, we&#8217;d have to pay for their keep in some other
way. They would be &#8217;on the town.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the town!&#8221; The phrase haunted me. I walked
home past the golf links, where comfortable males
in knickerbockers were losing 75-cent balls, past two
estates that cost a hundred thousand dollars apiece,
past the groggy signpost which pointed to Albany and
Twin Fires, and saw my own pleasant acres, with the
white house above the orchard slope, the ghost of Rome
in roses marching across the sundial lawn, the fertile
tillage beyond. Far off in every direction stretched the
green countryside to the ring of hills. Why should
anybody, in such a pleasant land, be &#8220;on the town?&#8221;
Why should some of us own acres upon acres of this
land and others own nothing? None of us made the
land. None of us cleared it, won it from the wilderness.
If any white men had a right to it to-day, surely they
would be the descendants of the original pioneers. Yet
one of those descendants now did our washing, and
owned but a scrubby acre of the great tract which had
once stood in her ancestor&#8217;s name. Why had the acres
slipped away in the intervening generations? In that
case, I knew. The land had gone to pay for the liquor
which had devastated the stock. In other cases, no
doubt, a similar cause could be found. Then, too, in
many cases the best blood of the families had gone
away to feed the cities&#8211;to make New York great. The
weaker blood had remained behind, not to mingle with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
fresh blood, but to cross too often with its own strain,
till something perilously close to degeneracy resulted.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the town!&#8221; The town had once been a community
of hardy pioneers, all firm in the iron faith of
Calvin and Jonathan Edwards, all independent and
self-respecting, even though they did call themselves
&#8220;poor worms&#8221; on the Sabbath. The faith and the
independence alike were gone. They bled the town for
little jobs, badly done, to keep out of the poorhouse.
The rugged pioneer community had become, I suddenly
saw, a rural backwater. The great tide of agricultural
prosperity had swept on to the West; industrial
prosperity had withdrawn into the cities. We, in rural
New England, were entering the twentieth century with
a new problem on our hands.</p>

<p>And I felt utterly helpless to solve it. But it has
never since then ceased to be troublesome in the background
of my consciousness, and when I see the road
work being done by &#8220;town labour,&#8221; I think of what
that means; I think of the farms abandoned to summer
estates or weeds, the terrible toll of whiskey and cider,
the price the city has exacted of the country, the pitiful
end of these my brothers of the Pilgrim breed. I reflect
that even in Twin Fires we cannot escape the terrible
problems of the modern world. This is the leaden
lining to that silver cloud which floats in the blue above
our dwelling.</p>

<p>But this story is, after all, an idyl, and the idyl is
drawing to its close. Even as the Old Three Decker
carried tired people to the Islands of the Blest, my little
tale can only end with &#8220;and they lived happy ever
after.&#8221; Into the sweet monotony of such happy years
what reader wants to follow? The reader sees his fellow
passengers, the characters, disembark, waves them
good-bye&#8211;and turns to sail for other isles! So please
consider that the hawsers are being loosed, the farewells
being spoken.</p>

<p>That second summer at Twin Fires, of course, showed
us many things yet to be done. Neither Rome nor the
humblest garden was ever built in a day. Our ramblers
did their duty well, but the grape arbour and the
pergola would not be covered properly in a season.
There were holes in the flower beds to be filled by annuals,
and mistakes made in succession, so that July
found us with many patches destitute of any bloom.
Out in the vegetable area there were first cutworms and
then drought and potato blight to be contended with.
In our ignorance we neglected to watch the hollyhocks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
for red rust till suddenly whole plants began to die,
and we had to spray madly with Bordeaux and pull off
a great heap of infected leaves, to save any blooms at
all. There were clearings to be made in the pines for
ferny spots, and constant work to be done about the
pool to keep the wild bushes from coming back. There
were chickens to be looked after now, also, and new
responsibilities in the village for both of us. We had
neither attempted nor desired to avoid our full share of
civic work. We lived a busy life, with not an hour in
the day idle, and few hours in the evening. We lived so
full a life, indeed, that it was only by preserving an absolute
routine for my own bread-winning labours, from nine&#160;<span class='sc'>a.m.</span> till one,
that I was able to resist the siren call of
farm and garden, and get my daily stint accomplished.</p>

<p>The preceding summer I had made about $200 out
of my produce, which in my first na√Øve enthusiasm
pleased me greatly. But it was surely a poor return
on my investment, reckoned merely in dollars and cents,
and the second season showed a different result. Having
two cows and a small family, I managed to dispose
of my surplus milk and cream to a farmer who ran
a milk route. This brought me in $73 a year. As I
further saved at least $100 by not having to buy milk,
and $60 by Peter&#8217;s efforts at the churn, and could
reckon a further profit from manure and calves, my
cows were worth between $300 and $400 a year to me.
Now that we had hens and chickens, we could reckon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
on another $100 saved in egg and poultry bills. To
this total I was able to add at the end of the summer
more than $500 received from the sale of fruit and vegetables,
not only to the market but to the hotels. I was
the only person in Bentford who had cultivated raspberries
for sale, for instance, and the fact that I could
deliver them absolutely fresh to the hotels was appreciated
in so delicate a fruit. Stella and Peter were
the pickers. I also supplied the inns with peas, cauliflowers,
and tomatoes. Thus the farm was actually
paying me in cash or saving at least $1,000 a year&#8211;indeed,
much more, since we had no fruit nor vegetable
bills the year through, Mrs. Pillig being an artist in
preserving what would not keep in the cellar. But we
will call it $1,000, and let the rest go as interest on
the investment represented by seeds and implements.
To offset this, I paid Mike $600 a year, and employed
his son Joe at $1.75 a day, for twenty weeks. This
left me a profit of about $200 on my first full season at
Twin Fires, which paid my taxes and bought my coal.
Out of my salary, then, came no rent, no bills for butter,
eggs, milk, poultry, nor vegetables. I had to pay Mrs.
Pillig her $20 a month therefrom, I had to pay the upkeep
of the place, and grocery and meat bills (the latter
being comparatively small in summer). But with the
great item of rent eliminated, and my farm help paying
for itself, it was astonishing to me to contemplate what
a beautiful, comfortable home we were able to afford
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
on an income which in New York would coop us in
an Upper West Side apartment. We had thirty acres
of beautiful land, we had a brook, a pine grove, an orchard,
a not too formal garden, a lovely house in which
we were slowly assembling mahogany furniture which
fitted it. We had summer society as sophisticated as
we cared to mix with, and winter society to which we
could give gladly of our own stores of knowledge or
enthusiasm and find joy in the giving. We had health
as never before, and air and sunshine and a world of
beauty all about us to the far blue wall of hills.</p>

<p>Above all, we had the perpetual incentive of gardening
to keep our eyes toward the future. A true garden,
like a life well lived, is forever becoming, forever in process,
forever leading on toward new goals. Life, indeed,
goes hand in hand with your garden, and never a fair
thought but you write it in flowers, never a beautiful
picture but you paint it if you can, and with the striving
learn patience, and with the half accomplishment,
the &#8220;divine unrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>reads the ancient motto on our dial plate, and as I look
back on the years of Twin Fires&#8217; genesis, or forward into
the future, the hours that are not sunny are indeed not
marked for me. I am writing now at a table beneath
the pergola. The floor is of brick, laid (somewhat irregularly)
by Stella and me, for we still are poor, as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
Eckstroms would reckon poverty, and none of what
Mrs. Deland has called &#8220;the grim inhibitions of wealth&#8221;
prevents us from doing whatever we can with our own
hands, and finding therein a double satisfaction. Over
my head rustle the thick vines&#8211;a wistaria among them,
which may or may not survive another winter.</p>

<p>It is June again. The ghost of Rome in roses is
marching across the lawn beyond the white sundial, and
there are arches in perspective now beneath the level
superstructure. The little brick bird bath is covered
with ivy, and last year&#8217;s self-sown double Emperor
Williams are already blue about it. The lawn is a thick,
rich green. To the west the grape arbour rises above a
white bench of real marble, and I can see dappled
shadows beneath the whitish young leaves. I know
that around the pool stately Japanese iris are budding
now, great clumps of them revelling in the moisture they
so dearly love, soon to break into blooms as large as
plates, and beyond them is a little lawn, with the bench
our own hands made against a clump of cedars, and on
each side a small statue of marble on a slender chestnut
pedestal, carved and painted to balance the bench.</p>

<p>I know also that a path now wanders up the brook
almost to the road, amid the wild tangle, and ends
suddenly in the most unexpected nook beneath a willow
tree, where irises fringe a second tiny pool. I know that
the path still wanders the other way into the pines&#8211;pines
larger now and more murmurous of the sea&#8211;past
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
beds of ferns and a lone cardinal flower that will bloom
in a shaft of sunlight. Somewhere down that path my
wife is wandering, and she is not alone. A little form
(at least she says it has form!) sleeps beside her, while
she sits, perhaps, with a book or more likely with sewing
in her busy fingers, or more likely still with hands that
stray toward the sleeping child and ears that listen to
the sea-shell murmur of the pines whispering secrets of
the future. Is he to be a Napoleon or a Pasteur? No
less a genius, surely, the prophetic pines whisper to the
listening mother!</p>

<p>My own pen halts in its progress and the ink dries on
the point.</p>

<div style='text-align:center; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;'>
<img src='images/illus-302.jpg' alt='' />
</div>

<p>&#8211;that indeed we desire for our children, for our loved
ones! Dim, forgotten perils of adolescence come to my
mind, as a cloud obscures the summer sun. Then the
cloud sweeps by. I see the white dial post focussing the
sunlight once again on the green lawn, amid its ring of
stately queens, and the thought comes over me not that
I possess these thirty acres of Twin Fires, but that they
possess me, that they are mine only in trust to do their
bidding, to hand them on still fairer than I found them
to the new generation of my stock. They are the Upton
home&#8211;forever.</p>

<p>Already we have bought a tall grandfather&#8217;s clock,
with little Nat&#8217;s name and birth date on a plate inside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
the door. I can hear it ticking somnolently now, out in
the hall. Already the quaint rubbish is accumulating in
our attic which in twenty years will be a dusty, historical
record of many things, from sartorial styles to literary
fashions. Some day little Nat will rummage them for
forgotten books of his childhood, and come upon my
derby, now in the latest fashion, to wonder that men
ever wore such outlandish headgear.</p>

<p>But the garden will never be out of fashion! Looking
forth again from the window, I can see our best discovery
of last season beginning to scatter its bits of sky
on the ground, as it does every day before noon. It is
flax, which blooms every day at sunrise the season
through, sheds all its petals when the sun is high, and
renews them all with the next day&#8217;s dew. It is perfectly
hardy and reproduces itself in great quantity. No blue
is quite like it save the sky, and at seven o&#8217;clock of a
fresh June morning you will go many a mile before you
find anything so lovely as our garden borders. A little
later, too, the first sowing of our schyzanthus will begin
to flower, against a backing of white platycodons, and
that will be an old-fashioned feature of delicate bloom
perpetually new, for the little butterfly flower, as it
used to be called, covering the entire graceful plant with
orchidlike blossoms, is one of those shyer effects that the
professional gardeners never strive for, but which we
amateurs who are poor enough to be our own gardeners
achieve, to put the great expensive formal gardens to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
shame. Another bed we are proud of is filled with love-in-a-mist
rising out of sweet alyssum&#8211;all feathery blue
and white, like our own skies. But we, too, have the
showier effects. Already the best of them is coming&#8211;about
a hundred feet of larkspur along the west wall of
the garden, and at its base pink Canterbury bells. Unfortunately,
the bells will be passing as the larkspur
comes to its fullest flower, but for about four or five days
in ordinary seasons that particular border of pink and
blue is a rare delight.</p>

<p>I wonder, by the way, if Stella has watered the
schyzanthus plants this morning. They are down in
the borders by the pool. Perhaps I had better go and
see. A moment&#8217;s respite from my toil will do me good.
I will listen to the tinkle of the brook, as I will follow
the path that wanders beside it through the maples to
the pines, where our garden is but the reproduction
in little of our fair New England woods. At the spot
where first we heard the hermit sing I shall find my wife
and child, I shall find them for whom all my strivings
are, who give meaning to my life, who, when all is said,
are the sunshine of its serene hours. What a blue sky
overhead where the cloud ships ride! What a burst of
song from the oriole! What a pleasant sound from the
field beyond the roses&#8211;the soft chip of Mike&#8217;s hoe between
the onions! And hark, from the pines a tiny cry!
Can he want his father?</p>

<p>This is a bright, cheery tale with the scenes laid in Indiana. The story
is told by Little Sister, the youngest member of a large family, but it
is concerned not so much with childish doings as with the love affairs
of older members of the family. Chief among them is that of Laddie, the
older brother whom Little Sister adores, and the Princess, an English
girl who has come to live in the neighborhood and about whose family
there hangs a mystery. There is a wedding midway in the book and a
double wedding at the close.</p>

<p><span class='ul'>THE HARVESTER.</span> Illustrated by W. L. Jacobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Harvester,&#8221; David Langston, is a man of the woods and
fields, who draws his living from the prodigal hand of Mother
Nature herself. If the book had nothing in it but the splendid figure
of this man it would be notable. But when the Girl comes to his
&#8220;Medicine Woods,&#8221; and the Harvester&#8217;s whole being realizes that
this is the highest point of life which has come to him&#8211;there begins
a romance of the rarest idyllic quality.</p>

<p>Freckles is a nameless waif when the tale opens, but the way in

great Limberlost Swamp; the manner in which everyone who meets
him succumbs to the charm of his engaging personality; and his
love-story with &#8220;The Angel&#8221; are full of real sentiment.</p>

<p><span class='ul'>A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST.</span> Illustrated by Wladyslaw T. Brenda.</p>

<p>The story of a girl of the Michigan woods; a buoyant, lovable

barren and unpromising surroundings those rewards of high courage.</p>

<p><span class='ul'>AT THE FOOT OF THE RAINBOW.</span> Illustrations in colors by Oliver Kemp.</p>

<p>The scene of this charming love story is laid in Central Indiana.
The story is one of devoted friendship, and tender self-sacrificing
love. The novel is brimful of the most beautiful word painting of
nature, and its pathos and tender sentiment will endear it to all.</p>

<p>A charming story of a quaint corner of New England where bygone romance
finds a modern parallel. The story centers round the coming of love to
the young people on the staff of a newspaper&#8211;and it is one of the
prettiest, sweetest and quaintest of old fashioned love stories, * * * a

a quaint humor of expression and a quiet feeling of pathos which give a
touch of active realism to all her writings. In &#8220;A Spinner in the
Sun&#8221; she tells an old-fashioned love story, of a veiled lady who
lives in solitude and whose features her neighbors have never seen.
There is a mystery at the heart of the book that throws over it the
glamour of romance.</p>

<p><span class='ul'>THE MASTER&#8217;S VIOLIN.</span></p>

<p>A love story in a musical atmosphere. A picturesque, old German virtuoso
is the reverent possessor of a genuine &#8220;Cremona.&#8221; He consents to
take for his pupil a handsome youth who proves to have an aptitude for
technique, but not the soul of an artist. The youth has led the happy,
careless life of a modern, well-to-do young American and he cannot, with
his meagre past, express the love, the passion and the tragedies of life
and all its happy phases as can the master who has lived life in all its
fulness. But a girl comes into his life&#8211;a beautiful bit of human
driftwood that his aunt had taken into her heart and home, and through
his passionate love for her, he learns the lessons that life has to
give&#8211;and his soul awakes.</p>

<p>Founded on a fact that all artists realize.</p>

<p><span class='ul'>BEN HUR.</span> A Tale of the Christ. By General Lew Wallace</p>

<p>This famous Religious-Historical Romance with its mighty story,
brilliant pageantry, thrilling action and deep religious reverence,
hardly requires an outline. The whole world has placed &#8220;Ben Hur&#8221;
on a height of pre-eminence which no other novel of its time has
reached. The clashing of rivalry and the deepest human passions,
the perfect reproduction of brilliant Roman life, and the tense, fierce
atmosphere of the arena have kept their deep fascination.</p>

<p><span class='ul'>THE PRINCE OE INDIA.</span> By General Lew Wallace</p>

<p>A glowing romance of the Byzantine Empire, showing, with vivid
imagination, the possible forces behind the internal decay of the Empire
that hastened the fall of Constantinople.</p>

<p>The foreground figure is the person known to all as the Wandering Jew,
at this time appearing as the Prince of India, with vast stores of
wealth, and is supposed to have instigated many wars and fomented the
Crusades.</p>

<p>Mohammed&#8217;s love for the Princess Irene is beautifully wrought
into the story, and the book as a whole is a marvelous work both
historically and romantically.</p>

<p><span class='ul'>THE FAIR GOD.</span> By General Lew Wallace. A Tale of the Conquest of Mexico.</p>

and dramatic than the drama played in Mexico by Cortes. As a
dazzling picture of Mexico and the Montezumas it leaves nothing to
be desired.</p>

<p>The artist has caught with rare enthusiasm the spirit of the
Spanish conquerors of Mexico, its beauty and glory and romance.</p>

<p><span class='ul'>TARRY THOU TILL I COME.</span> or, Salathiel, the Wandering Jew. By George Croly.</p>

chiefly in Palestine, from the time of the Crucifixion to the
